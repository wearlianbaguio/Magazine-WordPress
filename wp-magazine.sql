I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It&#8217;s been a while since I talked to you about the digital divide. In case you&#8217;re a brand new listener, check out episode 17, and actually everyone, just go check out episode 17 because bridging the digital divide, teaching people how to embrace technology fully and how to make it work for you, is one of the primary motivators of my decisions in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> WordPress&#8217;s unique position as both a tool that&#8217;s ubiquitous in its use and a community that is all-encompassing in its skill set means that if you know a bit about how open source works, you can use it as a tool to learn digital literacy and practice technical skills. Even though this is one of my primary motivators, I have never actually succeeded at getting WordPress into schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying, it&#8217;s not for lack of interest from the community; it&#8217;s more that it&#8217;s hard to fit into curriculum-based learning. After all, we&#8217;ve had ways to learn WordPress for as long as we&#8217;ve had ways to use WordPress. It&#8217;s just that it takes a long time to design instructional material, even when you know the content like the back of your hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And open source stuff just moves really quickly. However, that didn&#8217;t stop us from spending years refining the content that we do have into the learning pathways you can now find on learn.WordPress.org. If you&#8217;re an educator, you can use those almost out of the box. But if you&#8217;ve got learners in your home and want to make a case for why their school should bring a little WordPress based digital literacy into the classroom, I&#8217;ve got five good arguments for you for why they should give us a chance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first one, as I mentioned before, WordPress as a tool is practically ubiquitous. It powers a significant portion of the web, so it&#8217;s easy to find examples to aspire to and content creators for guidance. And given that it is so prevalent, knowing WordPress ensures that students are well prepared for a wide range of job opportunities in the digital industry, making them more competitive in the job market overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is that WordPress is a free and open source piece of software. In our case, it&#8217;s free in both meanings of the word. Free, as in no cost and no constraints. That means students have freedom to experiment with the code and with the design, which gives you that feeling of joyous experimentation that a lot of us had at the start of the web before there were CMSs. It taps into a different kind of creativity that results in technical curiosity and, ultimately, growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that the best way to learn WordPress happens to also align with the concept of project-based learning, which is one of the best methods for learning in general. I believe that to be true. I&#8217;m not an educator, but I really believe that project-based learning is the best way to learn complex topics. It&#8217;s an active way to learn. You get a bunch of tactical skills in there, like development, alongside the basics of good collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Obviously, these are all skills that are directly valuable in the workplace, but I have also found them profoundly useful in my day-to-day existence. You know, as a human participating in a society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number four is a bit of a spicy nugget, but WordPress is essential for creating and managing digital content, which is table stakes right now. That&#8217;s a foundational skill for most web dev jobs, but also marketing, journalism, and communications. And beyond that, everyone knows that your best leaders are the people who can tell a compelling story based on the information they have. The ones who can connect the dots in a way that makes it matter to you. This is a spicy, of course, because of the confusing do si do that AI is taking with the content landscape. But I believe that people are the best storytellers, and stories are what keep us all moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing is that there is a whole wide world of open source. There are so many products and projects that use an open source license, right? Like you, listener, I can guarantee I don&#8217;t even know who you are, but I can guarantee that you use at least one item a day that has some open source thing in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most of these open source projects are international. They&#8217;re developed on a global scale across numerous countries by people with various levels of education. And it&#8217;s this vastness of scope, this broadness of connection, that will give you, give your student, a chance to understand how to work across cultures, how to build something that is more than the sum of its parts, and how to embrace the concept of altruistic generosity that leads to a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Because just as I&#8217;m sure that you, a complete stranger, touched something open source today, I&#8217;m equally sure that the people we bring into open source will be able to solve the biggest problems of tomorrow with better connections and more skill because of what we taught them here today.&nbsp;If all of this sounds compelling, but you&#8217;re not ready to, like, go into your school administrator, your superintendent, your local, I don&#8217;t know, education board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this felt right, but you don&#8217;t know for sure, and you want a little bit more experience with it before you go advocate for it yourself, I will have in the show notes over on WordPress.org, I&#8217;ll have in the show notes of this podcast a series of events that are coming up. We have a couple that have already gone by WPCampus, I think just wrapped up a few weeks ago. But there are a handful of events that are happening across the world that is specific to youth wanting to learn technology, working with WordPress to get that done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then educators as well. You can also always stop by the Training Team and ask them questions about how this all works, why it works together their philosophies behind their learning pathways. There are so many ways that you can get answers to the questions that you might have about why open source, and especially WordPress, is worth trying to get your students exposed to and working in and contributing to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings me, now that I have finished with my little soapbox, to our small list of big things. Gosh, I hope you all missed hearing teeny tiny rants about WordPress and open source from me over the break that I took in August, but before you respond to that, feel free to respond to me in any comments. Let&#8217;s first get to the small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, the full WordCamp US schedule has been released, so if you&#8217;re planning to attend that, you can take a look and get your schedule, your personal schedule, for the week figured out. But if you&#8217;re still on the fence, there might be a speaker or two in there that tips the scales for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship Program Cohort number three, the third one, will happen in Q4 this year. The call for mentors and mentees has just been completed. But you should keep an eye out on September 9th, I think. So, at the end of this week, the final list will be announced. This program has been excellent for mentors to give back to the community while enhancing their leadership skills. And the mentees who participate have received personalized guidance and a chance to develop skills and network within the community, and a good portion of them continue to contribute to WordPress itself and other open source projects that we rely on as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that YouTube has been an essential platform for sharing complex ideas with a diverse audience. And our WordPress YouTube channel is no exception. It has been slowly warming itself up. We have a team that&#8217;s warming up the content over there. WordCamp information gets on it now. But in keeping with our commitment to meeting the needs of both current and future users, just making sure that we meet people where they are, I&#8217;m excited to announce that Jamie Marsland will be taking on the management of the WordPress YouTube channel. So for anyone who&#8217;s attending WordCamp US, stop by and say hello to Jamie in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, finally, I have a really important call to action. So, we are still working to reactivate our meetup groups. The Community Team is driving that charge, and they need your help to reactivate any group that&#8217;s inactive. Last month, a list of groups was shared and marked for removal from our chapter program. And we requested responses by August 5th to keep those groups active, but due to the summer holiday, we have extended it a little bit. We&#8217;ve extended it to September 16th, which, if I am remembering my calendar correctly, is a couple weeks from now. So if your group is on that pending closure list, email support@wordcamp.org to let us know if you want to reactivate the group or if you are ready to step down and have a new leader show up, and we can help you figure out how to get that done. Either way, if you&#8217;re on the list, email us let us know what your hopes and, dreams, and plans are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:09:58]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

It brings a unified look and feel that’s modern, visual, and inviting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"919\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=1024%2C919&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17613\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=1024%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=300%2C269&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=768%2C690&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=1536%2C1379&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?resize=2048%2C1839&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/2-learn-1.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond its fresh aesthetic, the new Learn WordPress site prioritizes learners with a revamped user experience consistent with familiar modern learning platforms. It features a new navigation menu, eye-catching thumbnails, and search filters so you can explore and discover content quickly. The clearer and more structured layout helps you easily recognize the resources you need (courses, lessons, Online Workshops) based on your learning preferences. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing Learning Pathways</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This redesign also highlights a new approach to Learn WordPress content, emphasizing what learners engage with the most. The introduction of Learning Pathways lets you grow your WordPress skills progressively. You can start with beginner essentials and then work your way through more advanced concepts at your own speed. This method lets you build a solid understanding as you move through each course. Learning Pathways are geared toward specific learners, like people using WordPress for the first time or those interested in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1024%2C730&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1536%2C1095&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=2048%2C1460&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Four Learning Pathways are already launched and ready to explore:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-user/\">Beginner WordPress User</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-wordpress-user/\">Intermediate WordPress User</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-developer/\">Beginner WordPress Developer&nbsp;</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-theme-developer/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-theme-developer/\">Intermediate Theme Developer</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can look forward to more Learning Pathways in the User and Developer tracks soon.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Last week, we released WordPress 6.6, and I had a chance to chat with a long-time contributor and member of the Release Squad about it.&nbsp;Today, I have with me Meher, and she was, well I guess I will let her tell us what she did with the release, but at the time of this recording, yesterday we had the WordPress 6.6 release, codenamed &#8216;Dorsey,&#8217; and so Meher, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05] <strong>Meher:</strong> Hi, thank you for inviting me. It&#8217;s nice to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:01:09]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, what you do in the WordPress project, how long you&#8217;ve been contributing, and then the role that you played in our big, big mid-year release?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:19] <strong>Meher:</strong> So my name is Meher. I&#8217;m a front-end developer. I&#8217;m also a CEO of KDC. I&#8217;m also a codable expert in WordPress. I started with contributing into the marketing field. Then, slowly, for 5.6, I got to be on the release squad, learned about training, about how the release goes, process happens. From that time onwards, I&#8217;ve been part of marketing or, basically, I&#8217;ve been part of the marketing team for all the releases. For 6.6, I picked to do the Release Coordinator, something different, something new, wanting to know what goes into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That is a big leap from like hanging out in marketing to going to be the Release Coordinator. Before we get into the release itself, just what made you think to yourself, I would like to do that? I would like to stand up and wrangle all of these contributors across the world. Make sure we get a release out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> I wanted to try something new. Like even in WordCamp, each role is different. So, even in the release, I wanted to try each different things. And like 5.6, I was in documentation. Then, I was in marketing. So then I got used to marketing, so I stick with my, no, I stuck with marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:40] <strong>Meher:</strong> So this time, I want to try something different, and I want to see, you know, how easy was it to be a Release Coordinator because it&#8217;s a Release Coordinator, see, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a like a big thing coordinating so many people so many different teams going on, working together, and so yeah, it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Great. I&#8217;m glad that you found it fun. I always worry when people make big shifts. I&#8217;m like, did we put enough documentation to make it clear? Are they going to find it easy to get started or not? And I think you did a really great job with it. So congratulations, since that happened just yesterday, less than 24 hours ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:16] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes, less than 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So, from your position as the Release Coordinator, what are the biggest, like, one or two features that you really were excited to see get in this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, one of the biggest features was the style override patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] <strong>Meher:</strong> Which I found very useful because a lot of people are using patterns. So, you know, patterns override; if you wanna change something on a specific page, it&#8217;s really useful then just to, you know, recreate a second pattern and then to match up and all. And second, which I liked as a user, was the publish box on the post becoming very clear, very, you know, cluster-free, very minimalistic, and just so comfortable that a normal user will actually understand what is there instead of going to each dropdown and figuring out what needs to be done. So, for me, I think as a developer and user, these two are the fun features, which I like, which 6.5 had, so. There are many other features as well. These are the two great features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I don&#8217;t think that anyone can argue about the importance of making things a little easier to see, a little easier to use. It&#8217;s been a little bit since WordPress was like fall into it easy to use. I feel like we have been the easiest of the robust CMS systems for like a long time. I know I said CMS systems. That&#8217;s like saying pin number. I know that the S in CMS is systems, but anyway, that notwithstanding, we&#8217;ve been the easiest of the complex solutions for a long time, and I think it&#8217;s always great when we, when we take a moment to be like, what could we make a bit easier to just like, no instructions required you get in there and you can tell like, what any individual thing will do without necessarily, like you said, having to go into drop downs and reading a bunch of stuff a little guesswork is okay. And also, it&#8217;s clear that none of it is dangerous. And so I think that&#8217;s, I think that&#8217;s a a good change myself. So, I agree with your assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So the style override patterns, that&#8217;s part of the suite of design tools that we&#8217;re pulling together, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> in your experience, you said you&#8217;re the CEO of your company, like in your experience, does that feel like something that&#8217;s super useful for agencies or particularly useful for freelancers, or should it generally be useful for everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:47] <strong>Meher:</strong> It will be useful from a small business point to a freelancer as well because we always try, like, in each page, we always, you know, there is some bits repeated, you know, so, patterns makes it easier, and syndicate pattern makes it more easier so that you can just duplicate and have one place to change. And, like, you have ten pages, you have one pattern across ten pages. The 11th page, you want the same pattern, but little change in that. It&#8217;s easier. It&#8217;s good because you can just change on that page, one particular thing and still go in the parent and change other things to reflect in that. So it will be very helpful for freelancers, small agencies. I do see big agencies take advantage of it. So overall, it should help everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Good. Good. I, for one, isn&#8217;t it great when we can get a feature out that mostly is going to help everyone. But I have been especially interested in the features that we&#8217;re trying to get out that help that kind of like small to medium agency area. I feel like we have a lot of folks in the WordPress community who do exactly what you&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;re getting something together. You have a mostly what you need across your site. You have one style that&#8217;s out there, but there&#8217;s this one area that you want to have a little bit more personality or a little less personality, depending on what your client is looking for, like this one is applying for jobs, and it needs to be a little less exciting or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think that&#8217;s great that we have that option. So you don&#8217;t have to try to, I don&#8217;t know, hack your way through that. I know that we&#8217;re not a super get-in-there-and hack-on-it sort of group anymore these days, but I love that we still have that feeling of we&#8217;re gonna, we&#8217;re going to make this a safe hacking space for you. Just get in there and make it work. So that&#8217;s excellent. Excellent. So for you, then, personally, cause you wear a lot of hats, you&#8217;ve your front-end developer; you&#8217;re running your company, you&#8217;re working, you&#8217;re a codable expert. You&#8217;ve got all these things. So from your perspective, what is the thing that got into this release that was a surprising, like a diamond in the rough for you, like a surprising good feature when you just thought it was like an important feature at some point? Was there one that seemed like it was a good idea but became a great idea by the time it was out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, I would say style variations because I did not expect the final style variation to be what it is. A theme developer can create the theme, can add styles, can add fonts, can give different design elements to the theme as a normal user when they when someone wants to just pull up a website, but they&#8217;re not good in design, or they don&#8217;t know which font to use. They choose which font, but then it doesn&#8217;t work. So if the theme provides an easy option just to shift the different styles they&#8217;re using and combining with the fonts. It is a much bigger opportunity for everyone because a normal user can just, they have a black and white site. I want to shift to a colorful site. Just go and see what the theme art has given you and shift it. So I think that I was surprised and I like the outcome. I&#8217;m sure my blogger friends also will like it because then they don&#8217;t have to depend on a designer to you know, give them color schemes and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. Yeah. So unrelated. It&#8217;s only, it&#8217;s kind of related. I shouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s unrelated. It&#8217;s all about WordPress. And now it&#8217;s about color palettes. So, I have a new design on my blog. And unfortunately I am the sort of person that does need a designer to tell me what I meant by the thing I thought. <span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">And so, like, I had this idea of the sort of color palette that I wanted and was searching for color palettes inside themes, which I was not succeeding at.</span> And eventually I had a designer who was happy to help you figure this out and get something out there. And they got me something that&#8217;s absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s got an excellent color palette and they redid some images for me. So it looks nice and hip and feels kind of modern. I think it&#8217;s great. But the one thing that I consistently felt confident to mess with while I was in there, because I think they did some custom work in there too, is all of the stuff that&#8217;s included in style variations. Like, I&#8217;m not touching colors because I can&#8217;t put colors together to save my life. But I was pleasantly surprised also by that particular feature. It gives you a feeling of I can change the face of this through the fonts or whatever it is. And I think that&#8217;s a nice, a nice thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> And it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a perfect combination. Color and font. Because a lot of people don&#8217;t know today&#8217;s time which font is good. Or which font is needed for an industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. Fortunately, I&#8217;m a site manager of one. And so I just had to ask myself if I liked the font and moved on from there. So, oh. So, like I said, as we&#8217;re recording this, we are less than 24 hours past the release. How was your experience with this release? Was it enjoyable? Did it like expand your horizons? Were there surprises in how a release is run?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:43] <strong>Meher:</strong> There was no surprises because I&#8217;ve already been a part of a release. So I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s&nbsp;fair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Meher:</strong> You know, it&#8217;s depends on what happens on the day.&nbsp;But yes, behind the scenes, following up, just checking in to make sure, are we on time, do we need more time, or what needs, you know, how much more time is required. It was fairly good, I was only clearly concerned about on the day of the release, because there&#8217;s a lot of things to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Meher:</strong> Usually, the party of the beta and the RCs finish in less than hour or so. But the final has a lot more detailed steps and many people to ping, to get, you know, them on the day of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, for folks who have never watched a release happen. So, I think a lot of the folks who listen to this podcast, they find it in the dashboard, they don&#8217;t necessarily contribute to WordPress. But, like, if you&#8217;ve never watched a WordPress release, we have these release parties for every beta that goes out, every release candidate that goes out, and then the general release. And I always find them so fascinating because, we have hundreds of contributors over the course of an individual release. And then we have probably 50, 60 people who show up at, for some of you all, in the middle of the night and are just being directed, like their attention is just being directed here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I love watching it because I, I&#8217;m always in the release channel. I&#8217;m in the core channel. All of these are in Slack. And then I&#8217;m also in the admin channel where you have to do the flipping of switches and packaging things. And it&#8217;s really interesting to see, almost like a scan of a brain where things are lighting up for various things. <span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">Like, you do the pre-testing in the release channel, and then you do the general testing in the core channel.</span> And then we&#8217;ve got like a person who&#8217;s flipping switches in the back, in the admin area to make sure that it all gets together. And it&#8217;s just really interesting to see how it all works. And yeah, it&#8217;s a really fun thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear listener, if you have never, if you&#8217;ve never done this, you have another opportunity. And I think the next release is early in November or something. And even if you&#8217;re there as like a spectator, not necessarily ready to take part in the release, sometimes it&#8217;s kind of nice to see how much effort and how many people are showing up to work on any individual release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:13:01]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;This was your first time to lead the release parties, though, right?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes. My first time releasing a release party. Also, to the spectators who have never been a part of release, you can just come and say hi. Like, yesterday, on the day of the release, there was one participant who joined for the first time, and she did contribute.&nbsp;And she was amazed by how smooth it went through. And for me, the best part of any release is seeing the green tick when people start testing. So, you know, everything is smooth sailing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Meher:</strong> And we&#8217;ll reach the destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:36] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. It&#8217;s, it is a real testament to how well and how closely all of these folks can work together, which if you stop and think about the fact that everybody&#8217;s like all over the world, it&#8217;s all across the globe that this is happening. It is why WordPress works, right? All of these people, all of you coming together to do this on behalf of this software. How cool that you had somebody who joined for the first time and then they were able to contribute immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:02] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:04] <strong>Meher:</strong> Also, there are a lot of folks who&#8217;ve done it. So they&#8217;re always ready to help out. You know, if you&#8217;re stuck somewhere, as a first-time release lead, there were certain questions I had. There are a lot of people to guide you to the right direction or to say, this needs to go here, or you need to tell the audience this. A lot of support you get from the squad itself, plus the people who are not on the squad and who&#8217;ve done this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Absolutely. I remember the first release that I led I was the coordinator of it and I believe it was 5.0. I believe it was the one that we put Gutenberg in core with, and it was the most terrifying thing I&#8217;d ever done. Not because I hadn&#8217;t been watching these releases happening for years, but because it&#8217;s different participating and watching and then being the person who is like you said, like making sure that things are still going on time that you understand when you need to say, like, there&#8217;s no way that this works for users right now. We have to take it out and all those things. And then, yeah, the day of, the first time that you have to run one of those global meetings, be like, &#8216;everyone, we don&#8217;t have time for this. Move on&#8217;. That&#8217;s always a really hard first time. Well, cool. That&#8217;s so exciting. So I have a last question for you, and that is, you&#8217;ve kind of let us into it, for first-time contributors to a release, especially anyone who&#8217;s thinking about joining the release squad for the first time, do you have any advice, anything that you wish you had been told when you were coming into this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Come with an open mind and come with a thought that there are people to help you. Ask in any channel. There will be someone or the other who will answer you immediately or a little later, depending on the time zone, and will guide you to the right person or right documentation where you can read up because there is a lot of documentation, good documentation on releases, how it handles and what team is needed, what they are supposed to do. So, you, you have a friendly bunch of people. Just ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Excellent. I love it. I love that advice. That was really good advice. Don&#8217;t be scared. Everybody has answers, and they want to give them to you. I agree. That is a real strong truth for the WordPress project. Last thoughts: anything you want to share with the WordPress community with our community of listeners here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> Looking forward for new people joining the next release and seeing 6.7 new features, which I&#8217;m excited about, collaborative phase three coming into picture and excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So you can come join us, make.WordPress.org/core, or you can join us in the Slack instance. You can go to chat.WordPress.org and get signed up for that. We coordinate all of this in the core channel, and we hope to see every new contributor that&#8217;s been on the fence. We hope you show up. There&#8217;s a new meeting every two weeks just for y&#8217;all. Meher, this has been an excellent conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:56] <strong>Meher:</strong> Thank you for having me. It was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:58] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hopefully, you&#8217;ve had a chance to download the release and try it out on your own sites. As always, if you run into any bugs, let us know so that we can get them in the next point release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. I have a moderate-sized small list. The first one is that WordPress is a reminder, actually. It&#8217;s a lot of reminders this week if I get right down to it, but this first one is a reminder that one of our big-picture goals for 2024 was getting new users into our event series. Our goal, of course, is to warmly welcome more first-time attendees and new users, and future WordPressers at all of our events, and that&#8217;s something that you can help get done. So, for all of our event organizers, or if you have not organized an event yet and would like to, just so that you can meet the fellow WordPressers in your area or, get to grow your own network a little bit. We&#8217;ve got a few best practices that can help you to make sure that you have a good experience for first time attendees. For one, you should always consider some thoughtful event design. Craft your events with some first-time attendees in mind. You have to consider their needs and interests and potential barriers to participation. Second, it helps to have some targeted messaging. Ensure that you have promotional materials that highlight the benefits of attending, but also what new knowledge, skills, or professional connections folks will gain when they come. It&#8217;s also good to share success stories of past first-time attendees. And then just kind of a final note for that on outreach strategies. You should experiment with a range of marketing channels to reach professional new attendees. You can partner with local schools, professional organizations, and online communities who can help to spread the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on our small list of big things is a reminder that the Docs Team holds an online Contributor Day every fourth Tuesday. They&#8217;ve been doing this for about a year now. And I think that it&#8217;s one of the most engaging and fun new contributor experiences we have, which I realize might sound odd for documentation, but it&#8217;s a great team. It&#8217;s got a great number of team reps in it. And they&#8217;re looking for you. They&#8217;re looking out for you to come and join for your first time on a Contributor Day. The next one is actually tomorrow, July 23rd. I&#8217;ll have a link for that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the third thing on our list is a reminder about online workshops. These are live sessions where you can learn alongside other WordPress enthusiasts, and they&#8217;re, you know, safe spaces where you can come as you are, develop new ideas, explore issues that you&#8217;re having, ask questions, network over shared interests, exchange theories, collaborate, and honestly, thrive on a bit of problem-solving together. New workshops are happening all the time. You can check out the schedule to join in on a live session and even watch some of the previous sessions to see if it&#8217;s for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the final thing on our list is that there is a recap up of the first Media Corps Briefing that was held on June 27th, and it provided media partners with an overview of the Source of Truth and updates that were planned for WordPress 6.6, that was released last week. Obviously, we just talked to Meher about it. But that particular session featured guest Anne McCarthy, who explained and demoed some of the upcoming features and answered a bunch of questions from the participants. The briefing was recorded and published on the WordPress YouTube channel. Apart from the recording, you can also find a summary, the full transcript, and other relevant links from the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:20:42]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> As a steward of the WordPress community, one of the big overarching questions that I grapple with is how to make sure people who have just found out about us know how to get around. Obviously, there&#8217;s the contributor path, which is important to me because I am especially concerned with the longevity of our little open source community, but there&#8217;s also a path for folks who are learning how to use the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so, joining me today to talk through a project called Learning Pathways is Wes Theron. Wes, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> Good day. Thank you very much for having me. It&#8217;s a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Before we get into this project that we&#8217;re talking about, do you want to just tell me a little bit about who you are and what you do with the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:22] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah. So, as you know, my name is Wes Theron. I&#8217;m based in New Zealand, and I&#8217;m an instructional designer. And, I am part of the Training Team. So, most of my life revolves around creating learning content for learn.WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s quite a life. Teaching people how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, I teach WordPress. We run online workshops. I create video tutorials, courses, and now, of course, this great project we&#8217;re working on, Learning Pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So, I&#8217;ve talked about Learning Pathways a few times here on the podcast, but for folks who have not heard me talk about it or who just need a more in-depth understanding, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about this project as it stands today?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, so when Learn started out, I think the main goal was to just get learning content on the site. But, in May of last year, we shared an individual learning survey with folks, and we were hoping to basically find out what are the needs of the learners? What are learners after? And from that individual learner survey, we actually learned a few things. We learned that tutorials, courses, and online workshops were the most used content types. We also saw that web-based learning is the most popular learning method. And then there was a clear need for a structured way of consuming learning material. And that&#8217;s basically where the Learning Pathways project was born; to create Learning Pathways that basically target various types of learners, but also various skill levels. So July of last year, we started with outlines, creating outlines for these learner pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:10] <strong>Wes:</strong> And then, in October of last year, we actually started creating content. So, the first learner pathways we started working on was the User Learning Pathway and the Developer Learning Pathway. And what that entails is of course, creating a Learning Pathway for beginner users, intermediate users, and then advanced users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s how we kind of broke it up. And last week, the Beginner Developer Pathway was actually published, so that&#8217;s very exciting. And a few weeks before that, the Beginner WordPress User Pathway. And yeah, of course, we&#8217;ve got many other pathways in the pipeline that we want to work on. For example, a Designer Learning Pathway and even a Contributor Learning Pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, when we&#8217;re talking about pathways, what we mean is, like, we are figuring out what you probably need to know when you first arrive and then helping you to identify what you build on based on what your goals might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, obviously, the beginner user, the goal is basically just like, learn how to get WordPress doing stuff at all. Like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s an easy goal to understand. But when you all were doing the work to figure out what needed to be in the pathway for a beginner developer, and as you&#8217;re looking towards doing the work around intermediate and advanced topics, like how are you all able to determine what most likely you need in those various steps in the learning process?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, of course, a lot of research went into that. When we created the outlines for these Learning Pathways. We shared it with the community. We asked for feedback. And yeah, a lot of research was done to make sure we cover all the all the bases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know that there were a couple of different proposals about how to, like do skills assessments, maybe? There was something where like we were talking with companies that employ WordPress folks in the ecosystem, and then we were talking to WordPressers who were currently trying to make sure that their skills were advanced enough to get those jobs. And we were trying to figure out like the distance between those and where we actually have some concerns around like the language choices that they need, like basic developer language choices and jargon that goes in there and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So this, if I recall correctly, the research for this has been going on for like maybe two or three years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, definitely. And we&#8217;ve reached out to many stakeholders within the WordPress community. And as you say, even agencies, and businesses, you know, trying to find out what do they want people to know when they employ them. And yeah, then of course, speaking to the community, speaking, speaking to folks at WordCamps reaching out to folks an online workshops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, yeah, it&#8217;s definitely been an ongoing process and also seeing what resources are lacking and what needs to be there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, so, the very first, the very first iteration of any training that the WordPress project was offering on, I think it was on learn.WordPress.org, but I don&#8217;t actually know for sure, was a troubleshooting workshop, because when you are trying to figure out WordPress for the first time, when you are trying to figure out any software for the first time, being able to figure out what went wrong is a really important part of that. And so that was like the only workshop that existed over there for quite some time. And so it&#8217;s really nice to see how we have really, not only created a bunch of resources in general, if you all have not looked at learn.WordPress.org lately, it has, like, workshop outlines that you can use to do a training by yourself at your meetup group or at a school or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But then also, I want to say it was maybe two, three years ago, that you all, as a team, the Training Team, started doing these online workshops. And so, when you created the Learning Pathways, considering like how much time and research has gone into this project overall, did you all have learnings that came from those workshops that you had already done? Is this like a collection of workshops or is this something where you can do it at home and learn by yourself and then go someplace else and learn more about WordPress? Like how does that function in what we have already?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:45] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, so maybe I should first, maybe let&#8217;s define a learning pathway. So I, I thought about this, but a learning pathway, I would say, is a route taken by learner through a range of modules, lessons, and even courses to build knowledge progressively. So it&#8217;s similar to a course, but of course usually covers like a specific topic or subject where learning pathways usually have a larger goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the online workshops form part of the Learning Pathways project. And maybe I can also clarify that the teacher notes or the lesson plans that you refer to is something that&#8217;s also changing going forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, good. Because I wrote some of those, and I am not an instructional designer. And so, ha!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Wes:</strong> We&#8217;ve actually decided to move away from having two different content types. So, we had tutorials. You know, video tutorials, and we had lesson plans, and as you said, the lesson plans were notes that somebody could use to run an online workshop or to go to a WordCamp or at their local meetup and use that to teach something. But moving forward for Learning Pathways, we are actually just going to have one content type, namely lessons. And then lessons from part of creating a course or lessons from part of creating modules and then Learning Pathways. The other exciting thing, and something we haven&#8217;t mentioned, is that at the end of this month, when we launched the Learning Pathways or the first few Learning Pathways, it actually coincides with a website redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:18] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, yeah, beyond the lookout, hopefully, learn.WordPress.org is going to have a brand new face at the end, from the end of July or, yeah, or August. So, yeah, that&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Excellent. Excellent. So, you said that these Learning Pathways are part of a larger goal. Is that a goal for your learners or a goal for WordPress? A goal for the team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Wes:</strong> I would say all of the above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:42] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Goals for everybody. We&#8217;re like the Oprah of goals. Don&#8217;t come get me, Oprah. That&#8217;s all I got to say about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:48] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, I think for us as a team, at the end of the day, we want folks to be able to use the content and find the content and utilize all the learning material on learn.WordPress.org. And then, of course, at the end of the day, for learners, we want folks to be able to succeed in whatever they are trying to do. Is it to build their own website? Is it to maybe find a job as a developer? And. Yeah, I mean, the list can go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So, on the subject of wanting to help people succeed, I think that as far as I hear from the majority of contributors that I have worked with over the years, like helping other people figure out how to do this and making sure that they can succeed is always something that is top of mind for contributors to open source probably in general, but definitely to WordPress. Like, we really care about helping other people figure out how to have the same sort of benefits that we&#8217;ve had in the project and with the software. So if you have somebody who is familiar with all the bits and pieces of WordPress and really, really want to like show up and help teach some things. Is it the case that they can take part in like running a Learning Pathway? Is it something where we mostly need people to help us build some content? Like if we&#8217;ve got people who are just desperate to help other people succeed in WordPress, what kinds of things can they show up and help do on this project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yes, please come to the Training Team. There are many ways to get involved. If you just want to review content, you can do that. But yeah, we do have a need for content creators, folks, you know, creating a video lesson or putting their hand up and saying, I will actually create an entire module or an entire learning, a Learning Pathway. We do have some awesome contributors that&#8217;s part of the Training Team that are already doing that. Some people are writing scripts. Some folks are actually, you know, creating everything from the beginning to the end. So they are writing the script, they recording the video, publishing the video, et cetera. And then we&#8217;ve, of course, have people reviewing content. We&#8217;ve got folks running online workshops. If maybe creating video content is not their, is not their forte, they can can run online workshops. So yeah, many ways getting involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Wes:</strong> But Josepha, I wanted to point something else out that I haven&#8217;t done. I think there was a real need for Learning Pathways because, at the moment, if somebody new to WordPress or new to developing with WordPress wants to find learning content. You know, where do they go? What&#8217;s the main platform to go to? I think most people probably go to YouTube, right?&nbsp;But a lot of the content there are, are scattered and fragmented. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of learning material or learning about WordPress is all over the place. It&#8217;s not in one place. And as I said, a place where you can actually learn from A to Z, learn progressively learning in a structured way. Yes, we know there are courses available that you can pay for, but the awesome thing about this project is that we are providing these Learning Pathways, these learning resources, for free for folks to be able to work through at their own time. I know that&#8217;s something else you asked earlier on. So yes, this is a course in quotation marks; this is a Learning Pathway that somebody can start whenever it suits them, you know, in the comfort of their own home, and they can work through the Learning Pathway from the beginning to the end. Or, if they feel I actually know everything taught in module one and two, I&#8217;m going to start at module three, they can do that. They basically come in at their skill level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. I think it&#8217;s really important to try to meet people where they are. And I know that it&#8217;s difficult because, like, we don&#8217;t take a lot of data from our users. You don&#8217;t have to give us basically anything in order to use WordPress. And by basically, I mean you literally don&#8217;t have to give us anything to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so we always have some difficulty in figuring out what is it that our users need the most in order to succeed the quickest. And so I agree that there was a real need for this not only because, like, there&#8217;s plenty of content for getting from, like, some knowledge to a good amount of knowledge. There&#8217;s almost no content around, like, I didn&#8217;t know CMSs existed until yesterday, and now I need to quickly learn how to do it because it&#8217;s become a thing I need to do in my job. There&#8217;s some really clear, like use cases for being able to onboard quickly and progressively.<br><br>And I understand that, like, having a clear, structured way to learn doesn&#8217;t always fit with the idea of meeting people where they are. But I do really think that, that like what you were saying, it can be as structured as you need it to be. But also, if you get into it and you think to yourself, you know, I know this information already. I can move on to the next module. I can move on to the module after that. Similar to the way we do that at WordCamps also. If you get into a session and you thought it was going to be useful for you, and you discover that it&#8217;s not once you&#8217;re there, you don&#8217;t have to stay. You can go to a different room where they&#8217;re teaching about SEO if it turns out that you don&#8217;t need to learn about JavaScript today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I think that that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of the value that this is hoping to bring, like, because it is a little bit built one on top of the other when you discover that you have already learned something, you can easily try out the next step and know that it&#8217;s probably a good next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:38] <strong>Wes:</strong> Exactly. And if you maybe want to teach this to other folks. The plan is to, you know, we had lesson plans. We have a lot of lesson plans on Learn. But the plan is also to, instead of having, as I said, two different content types, is to have lessons but then add a tab where you can click on teacher notes and actually teach something as well if that is your goal. But yes, our lessons and modules also include quizzes and, hopefully, some practical activities. We&#8217;ve incorporated WordPress Playground where, where folks can actually, you know, test out what they&#8217;ve learned or test their knowledge. So yeah, I agree with you that you can basically join the Learning Pathway wherever you feel the most comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So we&#8217;ve been kind of in the weeds of the project itself, the program itself, and if you want to like do stuff with that and in that. Let&#8217;s switch gears a little bit and talk about just what people who are wanting to join those pathways would need to know. Do you have any advice for somebody who is just today learning about these Learning Pathways and they think to themselves, I definitely want to sign up for one of those. Like, for one, how do they get started? And for two, your like top two or three bits of advice for as they get started? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Wes:</strong> So you can make your way to learn.WordPress.org, and you can basically open the, the pathway, and you can start wherever, wherever you want to. We have made it possible to actually view these pathways or our content without logging in with your dot org profile. The other thing I also wanted to mention is that our content is actually hosted on YouTube now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the great thing is we have these pathways within YouTube as well. So, folks can go to the, YouTube channel and see our content. And, of course, that basically reaches a very wide audience. And hopefully some of those videos will also bring people to the dot org site so that they can access the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:57] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think it&#8217;s great that you don&#8217;t have to sign up for a profile. If you are a brand new WordPresser and ran into this in your dashboard and are listening to this podcast now. So dot org profiles are a place where you can kind of log your activity in the WordPress community and the WordPress project. You do not have to have one in order to use WordPress. You don&#8217;t have to have one in order to look at these courses or to learn from them. But I always think that it&#8217;s kind of nice to get your profile set up so that people kind of know who you are and what you&#8217;re doing. And then also your activity shows up. Like, you can see that you enrolled in the course and you get to know for yourself that you made some progress. I know that when you&#8217;re getting started, it&#8217;s hard to, like, see your progress because you don&#8217;t know how far you have to go. And so, like progress when you&#8217;re starting out is really difficult to feel is real. And so I like it just so that you have a few reminders to yourself, like, look how far I&#8217;ve come as you&#8217;re trying to figure out how far you still have to go. And so I like that a lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:58] <strong>Wes:</strong> You won&#8217;t be able to access all the content on Learn without your dot org profile. But one of the things we&#8217;ve made possible is to access these Learning Pathways, the new ones being launched without, you know, removing those blockers. So, of course, when you work through a Learning Pathway, you will be able to track your progress, and you will be able to see which lessons you have completed. So yeah, one of the pieces of advice I would give to somebody starting with the Learning Pathways actually to first go through the modules. And go through the lessons to see which things you know and feel comfortable with so that you don&#8217;t waste time maybe going through the first module and say, oh, I know this, and you&#8217;ve wasted time. Rather do a bit of research, a bit of reading, and then find the right place for you to start the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:45] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s excellent. I also, just as a learner, I try to always learn some stuff. And also, as you get older, it&#8217;s harder and harder to learn things partially because like you&#8217;re in a set path, but also, and here&#8217;s my advice to new learners: you worry about looking foolish. Like you, you worry, you&#8217;re showing up, and you don&#8217;t know anything about anybody else in the classroom. And so there&#8217;s this feeling of like, what if I&#8217;m the only person who does not know how to make this work? What if I&#8217;m the only person who can&#8217;t figure out what Wes meant by &#8220;Playground&#8221; or whatever it is? There&#8217;s this real feeling of looking silly when you&#8217;re doing something like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I can&#8217;t control what anybody else says or does to anyone else, unfortunately. But what I can say is that I think that there&#8217;s never a bad time to start something you wish you had done, right? Like, the best time to have learned how to use your CMS, your website, make your website work was probably a year ago or something, but the second best time is today. And so, like, why not go ahead and get started and be part of that small group of adults that are learning new things every single day? I think that&#8217;s great. And so that&#8217;s my tip is to just embrace looking silly sometimes because you&#8217;re making some choices about your future, and that&#8217;s always a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:04] <strong>Wes:</strong> And I would also say test your knowledge. So you&#8217;ve mentioned WordPress Playground. And as I said, we&#8217;ve incorporated into the Learning Pathways, but sometimes you watch a video, or you read something, and you feel like, oh yeah, I know this, but you know, the proof is in the pudding. So go and test it out. Use a test website or use WordPress Playground and test yourself to see if you can actually implement this or do something. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely one of the other tips I want to highlight; you know, they also say you, you learn by doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And also, like if you have gotten to a point you&#8217;ve done the learning, you&#8217;ve done some practicing, you think you&#8217;ve got it and want to like try to figure out what other things can be done with it. I recommend this is how I did a lot of my early WordPress learning to organize an event with your local meetup.<br><br>Like, I did not know enough about WordPress when I started organizing WordPress meetups. I literally knew nothing. And I basically brought people in and was like, hey, we need people to teach us about this, us being half me. Come in and teach us. And, and that can be a really good thing, partially because, like, you get to know your local folks and see what&#8217;s going on and get a sense for, like, what is out there, especially if you&#8217;re learning this in order to run a business or to accomplish something for your job that you already have, like knowing what&#8217;s out there is super helpful. But then I find that once you embrace the fact that sometimes you will look silly, and that&#8217;s the only way that we can know we&#8217;re learning something. Like once you&#8217;ve embraced it, having some people who are willing to look a little silly with you is kind of, kind of fun, kind of nice. Also, like we&#8217;re all going to look at this problem that we definitely don&#8217;t understand and hopefully look like, at the end, we know what we&#8217;re doing, but between looking at it the first time and at the end of this meetup, we&#8217;re all going to look a little bit silly, ask silly questions. And I think that that&#8217;s a really helpful thing, too. But yeah, knowing some basic information is a great place to start before you do that, especially if you get anxious about looking silly. And I think these pathways are going to really help to get folks a little bit of a leg up on those big questions that they have as you&#8217;re starting to learn how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So we talked about, like, tips and tricks for learners in general. But if you had something that you wanted to share with us that, like, you&#8217;re really excited about for either the Training Team or for the Learning Pathways in general, I think the Learning Pathways are slated to be shipped by, like, end of September or something. So, like, a lot of them are coming quite quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:38] <strong>Wes:</strong> So I am most excited about the website redesign and the new look and feel of the website. And also, you know, one of the goals for us as a Training Team is for learn.WordPress.org to be one of the places people come to and learn about WordPress. And I feel these Learning Pathways and the new website redesign and all the hard work that&#8217;s gone into this project is hopefully going to, make that happen. As I said, our content is also available on YouTube. So we&#8217;ve really tried to make it easy for folks to find our content and also now to digest our content in a progressive and in a structured way. Because, you know, learning is hard. And hopefully, these Learning Pathways have made it easier for folks to, as you said, to build on your knowledge. You know, a lot of times, there&#8217;s knowledge gaps. And I think that&#8217;s what makes learning so hard. And hopefully with these pathways, you can build that knowledge one step at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:44] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. And as is the way with open source, like we can only make these pieces of content better if you all show up and help us like try it out, learn some stuff, and tell us what was confusing. Tell us what was too big a step. Cause yeah, you&#8217;re right. There are some knowledge gaps and when you&#8217;re on the other side of knowing something, it is so hard to tell how big a step is, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so we need y&#8217;all to come in here and tell us very plainly as a new learner like that was eventually what I needed, but this part here was especially confusing. This part over here was too like too many little steps like we just we&#8217;re trying to make sure that it works for you WordPressers, future WordPressers of the world. And so yeah, come build some learning with us over here on the Training Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:35] <strong>Wes:</strong> And yes, please, we want feedback because, as you say, as we iterate, we want to improve. So there will be a place where you can provide feedback, and at the end of the pathway where there will also be a satisfaction survey for folks to to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Great. Well, folks, we&#8217;re gonna have a bunch of links in the show notes. There&#8217;s so much stuff out here to learn with and about WordPress. Wes, thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:01] <strong>Wes:</strong> Thank you for having me. And I will see you all on Learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:05] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things. Although I have to say we have a bunch of links that we&#8217;re going to share in the show notes. If you&#8217;re listening to this in a place where there are not show notes, you can head over to WordPress.org/news. That&#8217;s where we keep all of those. If you are lucky, we also will help you find it on Twitter/X, but I think that it&#8217;s hard to find things over there these days. So WordPress.org/news is your best bet. Now, it is time for the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first up on my list is that WordPress 6.5.5 is now available. It&#8217;s got a few fixes in it, some maintenance things and some security fixes as well. I recommend that you update your sites immediately. You can download it from WordPress.org/download, or you can just visit your WordPress dashboard. If you&#8217;re on a managed host, they may have already done this for you, too. But auto-updates, manual updates, CLI updates. However, you want to get it done, get it done. But it is recommended to do this as soon as possible. 6.5.5.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on my list is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship program has a call for interest out. This is a program that we launched about a year ago as well. And we had such a good bit of success at the end of the first round in February that there was significant interest in doing another cohort. So, that program connects seasoned WordPress contribution experts with folks who are new to contributing and offer a fantastic opportunity for mentees to gain hands-on experience contributing to WordPress while their mentors share their expertise and improve their leadership skills. So, most of the time, what you are going to be contributing to is probably a release of WordPress, but there are also a lot of opportunities to contribute to things like the Training Team that we&#8217;ve been talking about today and other teams as well. Not everything is focused all around our release cycle. We have things happening in the WordPress project literally all the time. It is a project that never sleeps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Speaking of projects that never sleep, our next official release, our second release of the year, is coming out. WordPress 6.6 is coming out just about a week from now. It is the second major release of 2024 and has a lot of things in it that you will want to check out. If you have not yet seen the hallway hangout where we take a look at what was happening in the release, what we intended to get into the release, take a look at it. And if you haven&#8217;t tested it yet, if you are one of our plugin developers, if you are building something on top of WordPress core, now is the time to check that out and test it against your products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is that it&#8217;s a new month, my friends. Here we are in July, and we have a ton of things happening in the project. That&#8217;s the theme of my small list of big things: the project that never sleeps. But we have a lot of team meetings that are happening. If you haven&#8217;t attended one in a while or even if you have never attended one of these meetings and you were trying to figure out when to start, now is as good a time as any. You can join your fellow community members and contribute to the WordPress project. And there are ways that you can do that from home and from your computer and for some parts of the project, like from your phone, if you are taking photos out and about and submitting those. So check out make.WordPress.org/meetings. It&#8217;ll give you a sense for everything that&#8217;s happening. Do not get overwhelmed by that calendar. You can just choose which team you think is most interesting to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Your small list of never-sleeping things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

Welcome to yet another session of the notorious, not-so-notorious-yet accessibility podcast at Do the Woo. With me today is Maestro Stevens from Iconic Templates. Now, some of you may know him, while to some of you, he may come as a total surprise. But I promise you, this is going to be a very entertaining conversation about scalability, accessibility, being part of the WordPress community—especially in that regard—and, of course, e-commerce and accessibility. But as usual, we are trying to get guests on the show who are in the midst of learning about or working with accessibility, instead of always featuring people who already know everything. There are so many people who don’t know yet, and we’re going to get the other specialists on for sure at some point. The goal is that we all learn how to implement accessibility in e-commerce because it&#8217;s incredibly important. We are all learning, we are all struggling, and we are all going to get there at some point. Also with us today is Bob Dunn, and today Bob is representing Taeka, who, due to circumstances, couldn’t be with us today. He is here to protect all of you from me and Maestro talking too much about unrelated things, because we like to babble, right, Bob?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Right? Yeah, yeah. I’ll be the podcast bouncer, and that’s it. I’m always accessible to do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, that’s wonderful. So, for people who don’t know me, a little bit of my background: I’m an accessibility specialist and a big mouth in the WordPress community. I love to connect people, I love to learn, I love to teach, and I hope I can bring you some extras every time we do this. And Maestro, I would say let’s go. Can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and what you’re doing in daily life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes, yes. Thank you, Anne, and thank you, Bob, as well for having me on. I’ve been greatly anticipating this opportunity. But just a little bit about me—as Anne already said, my name is Maestro Stevens, and I am the owner and founder of Iconic Templates. We are a template-based platform for WordPress. It mainly came from me being an advocate and a user of other people’s templates for years, starting my journey, I would say, back in 2008. So, I’m no WordPress &#8220;old-schooler&#8221; as I call it, like the people who came in way before me. But I definitely love the fact that WordPress has given me opportunities, flexibility, and new lessons as far as community and developing websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Alright, so what is your accessibility angle, just to put you on the spot?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />When it comes to e-commerce and accessibility, I would say I am a newbie on the cusp of becoming an intermediate person. For me, accessibility is still an ocean of wonders and questions. I’m not a technical person in terms of development, and what I’ve learned about accessibility has a lot to do with development practices and design practices as well. I’m neither a designer nor a developer, so my experience is more relatable to the average person. But what I’ve learned is the importance and necessity of accessibility, because there are many more people in the world who I assumed could access websites, but they can’t because of various disabilities or disadvantages. So, I’m learning. I’m a work in progress, but I’ve learned a lot so far. In the e-commerce world, especially, it’s critical—because people can’t buy what they can’t see. If they can’t access your website or experience it in certain ways, how can you expect them to purchase your product?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />And it’s not just about seeing, right? It’s always interesting that accessibility is thought of as something for people who are blind, but the group of people affected is so much larger. You’re missing out on a ton of conversions if your website is filled with sliders and moving elements. Accessibility as an important part of your conversion strategy is something people tend to forget. And I know you like to look at things from a larger perspective. I find it interesting that you don’t have a development background, because that’s important for everyone to know, especially when creating websites. I mean, WordPress enables us to install WooCommerce and create a webshop without knowing what we’re doing. In a sense, it guides us, which is wonderful. But if you’re working at a professional level, you have to understand—just like with bookkeeping—you don’t have to know how to do your own bookkeeping, but you need to be able to read the numbers. So, I’m challenging you here. This is what we call &#8220;shooting at an open goal.&#8221; Now, if there are conversion advantages to accessibility, especially in e-commerce, what advantages do you see? Can you expand on that? And I have the same question for Bob, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yeah, I’ll start with this: The reason I didn’t mention conversions is that I always try to speak to a C-level grade student audience. I consider myself a C-level student. And when I start using big words, people start asking more questions, and they get confused. So, I like to come up with little metaphors, similes, or simple ways to explain things that the average person can understand. Then I give them the &#8220;juice,&#8221; as we say. So yes, you&#8217;re absolutely right. It is about conversions. For example, if you have a button on your website that’s a certain color or it’s developed in a way that makes it jittery or weird, it can make it hard for someone to commit to moving forward to the next step, whether that’s a sale, a subscription, or joining your email list. So, in my opinion, that’s one example of how accessibility can affect conversions—using buttons. As far as I know, links and buttons are what move us forward to the next step on the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Links and buttons—those are an interesting topic. I’ll keep a mental note to get back to that. Bob, what about you? What does accessibility in e-commerce mean to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Well, I agree a lot with what Maestro said. It’s interesting because I think about accessibility and wonder where we draw the line. I’ll give you an example. Today I was on a site ordering something. When I got to the checkout and entered my address, it gave me two lines—one for the first part of the address and one for the second part. Our address is quite long, and when I hit &#8220;next step,&#8221; it moved the second part of the address onto the first line, saying, “Your address is limited to 34 characters.” So, I had to think, “How can I adjust this to make it deliverable?” And while that might be more of a technical issue with the checkout form, it made me think about accessibility—this was frustrating to me, and I can see and think through the problem. But what kind of issues would this pose for others? It’s strange—these little things can create big problems. For instance, I get vertigo sometimes, and scrolling can be tough for me. But if something comes on the screen with wiggly or strange movements because someone is trying to be clever, it becomes challenging. So, yeah, it’s a constant challenge for far more people than we might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, this is so true. Unfortunately, these issues are hard to measure when talking to companies. Whether it’s in the U.S., where they need to be compliant, or here in Europe, where the European Accessibility Act is going to hit like a tsunami, it’s important to understand. You are naming examples here, and they’re hard to measure. Companies complain that they pay SEO specialists thousands every month, and they celebrate when their click rate increases by half a percent. But at some point, they’ll notice that conversions are failing or bounce rates are high. You can spend all the money you want on SEO, but you’ll still have unexplained bounces if your website isn&#8217;t accessible. You can’t measure assistive technology usage—that would be an incredible breach of privacy. This is always a tough discussion between shop owners and companies that need to make their shops accessible. They want numbers, but common sense should also play a role. If you&#8217;re working on a webshop, whether you&#8217;re a developer or not, you need to understand basic things—like buttons and links. Few people outside of coding know that a button does something and a link goes somewhere. People like to wrap links in buttons that look like buttons. In hardcore accessibility circles, people will say, “Don’t do that,” but we’re talking about inclusion here, and everyone should be included, not just people who rely on assistive technology. We are all sensitive to certain stimuli, and we can all benefit from accessibility features. Have you ever tried turning your screen to black and white on your iPhone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes! To your point, I’ve noticed a trend where people are becoming more conscious of these things. In email templates, for instance, you can’t control the email client—whether it’s Gmail or Yahoo (does anyone still use Yahoo? I’m sure someone does!). And it’s interesting that with Apple’s iOS updates, they&#8217;re allowing users to change the gradients on icons. But when it comes to color changes, I’ve noticed that people who are accessibility-conscious will often change the default link color from blue to something more legible in dark mode, for example. Chrome, Safari, and other browsers all handle accessibility in their own ways, but they don’t always follow the same rulebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Doesn’t that scare you a little?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes! It’s both fascinating and scary. There are certain things you just can’t control. But what can you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />And going back to Bob’s example about the form—this is where UI and UX go hand in hand. People say you can’t make beautiful accessible websites, which is nonsense. But something practical like a form—I love it when a form is coded so it asks, “Do you want to autofill this?” That’s not just helpful for jittery users—it’s helpful for everyone. Accessibility is primarily intended for people who use assistive technology, but then it helps everyone else too. And it’s interesting to see how page builders and themes handle this. Some of them are like, “Hey, look at this beautiful form widget,” but wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you didn’t have to worry whether the browser will offer autofill options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes, and I’ve seen this a lot, especially with email templates. Different email clients handle accessibility differently, and it’s the same with browsers. But going back to your point—there are so many things we can’t control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, it’s like when you’re working with page builders or themes, and they offer these forms that look great, but are they accessible? You need to test that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Exactly. And this goes back to how accessibility affects conversions. If people can’t use your forms, how can they complete their purchase? It’s all connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Absolutely. So, we’ve covered a lot of ground here. Do you have any final thoughts, Maestro, before we wrap up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Just that accessibility is a journey. I’m still learning, and I hope to continue improving. It’s important for everyone to start somewhere, and we can all make a difference by making our websites more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Thank you so much for joining us today, Maestro. It was a pleasure having you on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of the <strong>All Things WordPress and WooCommerce</strong>, hosts <strong>Anne</strong> and BobWP are joined by <strong>Maestro Stevens</strong>, founder of <strong>Iconic Templates</strong>, as he shares his journey of learning accessibility for the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, they dive into the challenges, opportunities, and strategies for making online stores more accessible, not just for compliance but to improve conversions and user experience for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re new to accessibility or looking for ways to integrate it into your WordPress projects, this conversation offers valuable insights, practical tips, and reflections from professionals in the process of learning and implementing accessible web practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility is for Everyone</strong>: Accessibility isn’t just about making websites usable for people with visual impairments—it benefits everyone, including those with cognitive, physical, and situational challenges. Making a site accessible improves the overall user experience and helps more people engage with your content or products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility and Conversions</strong>: A key point in the discussion was that accessibility directly impacts conversions, especially in e-commerce. If users can&#8217;t navigate your site or interact with elements like buttons or forms, they can’t complete transactions. Accessible design helps remove barriers, ensuring that all users can take the desired actions, such as making purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing Awareness in WordPress</strong>: Both Maestro and Anne discussed the growing importance of accessibility in the WordPress and WooCommerce communities. WordPress is actively developing more accessible features, and WooCommerce is improving accessibility in product creation and checkout experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning is a Journey</strong>: <strong>Maestro</strong> shared that he’s still learning about accessibility and how to incorporate it into his projects. This is an important reminder that it’s okay to start small and grow your knowledge over time. Tools like the <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> plugin can help identify areas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration and Communication are Key</strong>: When making websites more accessible, collaboration between developers, designers, and clients is essential. Clear communication about the importance of accessibility can help shift mindsets and lead to better results. Approaching accessibility with respect and consideration encourages progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of Assistive Technology</strong>: Assistive technology is critical for people with disabilities, but there’s no easy way to measure how many people use it on your website. As Anne pointed out, some things like form autofill or visual simplicity can help many users, even those who don’t rely on assistive tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: As the conversation highlighted, accessibility is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly updating your website with accessibility in mind ensures that it remains usable for all visitors, including those with different abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://iconictemplates.com\">Iconic Templates</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maestrostevens/\">Maestro on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker\">Accessibility Checker by Equalize Digital</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 14:22:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Akismet: Demand Generation vs Lead Generation — Use Both to Grow Customers and Revenue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=284132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://akismet.com/blog/demand-generation-vs-lead-generation/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18397:\"<p>To make a customer, you first have to <em>attract</em> potential customers. But if all you ever do is <em>attract</em> them, and not engage and sell to them, your company won’t grow fast enough. This is why, when you hear about demand generation vs lead generation, your reaction should be that you need both, not one or the&nbsp;other.</p>\n\n\n<p>Neglect either one of these, and your revenue will eventually feel the effects. You’ll either shrink your pool of qualified leads and potential customers, or you’ll fail to convert as many as you should have the ones you have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, both lead generation and demand generation play huge roles in business growth. You need to commit to and succeed in both if you want to see sustained revenue increases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at each&nbsp;concept.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284132\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is demand&nbsp;generation?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation focuses on attracting new potential customers. In funnel speak, the focus here is on top-of-funnel marketing. You’re creating interest and curiosity about your products and services. You’re making people lean in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>When we talk about how marketing is about getting attention amid the intense competition and chaos of the digital world, we’re talking about demand generation. Getting noticed. Being memorable. Becoming part of the conversation in people’s&nbsp;minds.</p>\n\n\n<p>“Did you hear about….” is a demand generation question asked by someone who was successfully marketed to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"key-components-of-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key components of demand&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation refers to any type of marketing whose objective is to gain attention, interest, or curiosity. You’ll ask people to do things like click, read, open, watch, and comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goal is to position a product, service, or brand as something positive, helpful, useful, or trustworthy in your particular industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing could&nbsp;be:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helpful</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Informative</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Memorable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trust-building</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Educational </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easily-accessible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll use tactics such as social media marketing, influencer marketing, email campaigns that aren’t directly selling, giveaways, webinars, and free content. Larger companies might also use legacy media channels like TV and radio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-role-of-demand-generation-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of demand generation in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n<p>Not every potential customer is ready to buy right now. But if you’ve done effective demand generation marketing, when the time comes for them to buy, your company or product will be at the top of their&nbsp;mind.</p>\n\n\n<p>At the top of the sales funnel, people are just shopping around. They’re not ready to make decisions. They’re not ready to fill out forms, sign up for consultations, or give you their contact information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing engages people who aren’t even looking, and those who are looking but aren’t necessarily that serious about it yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a customer may be happy with their current car insurance. But they know they’re planning to buy a new car in the next couple of years, and when they do, they might take a fresh look at their insurance. Demand generation marketing gives them a direction to go when that time comes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kpis-and-measurement-of-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">KPIs and measurement of demand&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing, broadly speaking, gets measured with broad metrics. You’re focusing here on reach more than&nbsp;engagement.</p>\n\n\n<p>That means things like visibility, social mentions and shares, opens, click-through rates, and webpage traffic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is lead&nbsp;generation?</h2>\n\n\n<p>While demand generation is about creating desire, spurring positive feelings, and being remembered, lead generation is about inspiring action. With demand generation, no one has to commit to anything. With lead generation, someone is going to call you or fill out a form — and you’re expecting them to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we’ve moved down the funnel a bit. Desire has grown, and the motivation to act, engage, and possibly buy has taken over. Now, the lead is thinking, “I need this, or I want this, and maybe this is the direction to go.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve got their attention. Now, you’re converting that attention into something you hope results in a sale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"key-components-of-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key components of lead&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation refers to any type of marketing whose objective is to collect customer data, initiate follow-up, nurture a relationship, actively engage with prospects, or make an offer and complete a sale. You’ll be asking potential customers to do things like sign up, join, request, try a sample, start a free trial, or make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation always comes with some sort of offer, and usually that’s in exchange for their contact information. This is the goal — to obtain their information so you can follow up and pursue the relationship and an eventual&nbsp;sale.</p>\n\n<p>Lead generation marketing could&nbsp;be:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Direct</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specific</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helpful</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Empowering</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solution-oriented</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer-driven</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Urgent</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Media for lead generation marketing can overlap quite a bit with demand generation media, but it’s more in how you use it. You can use social media, but the call to action will be more specific than “learn&nbsp;more.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation tends to be much more effective when done with the help of marketing automation. With automation, you can develop follow-up processes and sequences that you can track for people at all sorts of stages in their customer journeys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead&#8209;gen marketing uses assets like landing pages, paid ads, live chat, and lead magnet tools like white papers, eBooks, free trials, and time&#8209;limited coupons and discounts for new&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Minimize friction at conversion points by reducing the number of fields that prospects must fill out. The quickest way to boost your results is to eliminate CAPTCHAs and other anti&#8209;spam checks. Instead, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">use Akismet</a> to block 99.99% of spam without interrupting the user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-role-of-lead-generation-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of lead generation in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n\n<p>With lead generation, you’re requiring a decision that carries some sort of consequence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prospect thinks, “Either I engage with this, and then I can expect certain things to follow, or I can choose not to engage.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation presumes a pre-existing level of interest. If someone complains about being “sold” by your marketing, in the negative sense, that simply means this person hasn’t yet experienced enough of your demand marketing. You’re pushing them too far, too early. They aren’t ready to give you their contact information. They feel “pressured.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a potential customer who knows what they need, knows what they’re looking for, and wants to find a good solution won’t respond to lead generation marketing like that at all. They want it. They want helpful content, answers, customer service, and the opportunity to move forward with someone they believe can help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kpis-and-measurement-of-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">KPIs and measurement of lead&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation gets measured by the sorts of metrics you can more directly link to revenue. This includes things like signups, responses, quote forms filled out, demos requested, free trials started, and conversions. Other lead generation metrics include cost per lead and lead response time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these metrics lead to money. More signups mean more sales. Lower lead response time means more leads engaged more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"key-differences-between-demand-and-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key differences between demand and lead&nbsp;generation</h2>\n\n<p>As you’ve probably picked up already, while some overlap exists between demand generation and lead generation, these are very different types of marketing. Let’s explore the differences in more&nbsp;detail.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-focus-and purpose\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core focus and&nbsp;purpose</h3>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing focuses on building an audience. When this type of marketing has worked, if you speak, people listen. If you make an announcement, people pay attention. You have their trust, or at least their awareness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation marketing works at converting the audience you’ve already built through demand generation. If you have 100,000 people who have expressed or felt some level of interest, how many of those can you motivate to give their contact information or request your lead magnet offer? That’s the question lead generation marketing is&nbsp;answering.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image.png\" alt=\"WPVIP lead capture form\" class=\"wp-image-284134\" />\n\n\n<h3 id=\"timing-and-stage-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timing and stage in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n\n<p>The timing of both of these types of marketing can vary dramatically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this can all happen in a single session with a new lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose a person already knows they need something you sell, but they haven’t acted on it yet. This person could be called a “warm unknown prospect.” Maybe they’re the type of person who makes fast decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This person sees a post on social media. Their interest is piqued because they’ve already been thinking about something they need related to the content of the post. So, they engage with the post by clicking on it, which takes them to an article on your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>From there, they explore your site, look at your products, and then come across a lead magnet offer for a 30&#8209;day coupon for new customers. They sign up. Now, the clock is ticking. In less than 30 days, this person could travel through all stages of the buying journey and make a purchase, becoming a&nbsp;customer.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it could go even faster than that. They could make a purchase the same&nbsp;day.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, the same process could be drawn out over months, even years, for another potential customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some industries have shorter sales cycles, and others have longer ones. Sometimes, you continue to nurture and develop the relationship merely to sustain interest. During that time, you also continue to make lead generation offers. Some in your audience will act on those offers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"strategies-and tactics\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strategies and&nbsp;tactics</h3>\n\n<p>Strategies for demand generation marketing include things&nbsp;like:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Attention&#8209;getting language or multimedia&nbsp;imagery</li>\n\n\n<li>Humor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trust-building content</li>\n\n\n<li>Low&#8209;stakes offers like reading reviews and consuming free&nbsp;content</li>\n\n<li>Consistent content and media&nbsp;presence</li>\n\n<li>Low or no&#8209;pressure&nbsp;content</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Strategies for lead generation marketing include things&nbsp;like:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Targeted and measurable offers — including free&nbsp;ones</li>\n\n<li>Lead magnets that collect contact&nbsp;information</li>\n\n\n<li>Follow-up emails</li>\n\n\n<li>Demonstrations, consultations, free&nbsp;trials</li>\n\n<li>New customer discounts, promotions, and&nbsp;giveaways</li>\n\n<li>CTAs that demand a&nbsp;decision</li></ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"measurement-and metrics\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Measurement and&nbsp;metrics</h3>\n\n<p>When demand generation works, your audience grows with people who are open to becoming a lead. You’re not reaching out directly to them yet, but if you did, they’d be more likely to be&nbsp;responsive.</p>\n\n\n<p>When lead generation works, your engaged audience is ready to consider becoming a customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You measure the metrics that support each of these outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation gets measured with visibility, likes, opens, shares, web traffic, views, and seconds or minutes watched, for something like a webinar or a YouTube ad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation gets measured with form submissions, demos and consultations scheduled and attended, redeemed coupons, converted free trials, as well as the process-metrics like cost per lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-you-need-both-lead-and-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why you need both lead and demand&nbsp;generation</h2>\n\n<p>You need both because each type of marketing fills missing gaps in the&nbsp;other.</p>\n\n<p>If all you do is demand generation, you’ll build an audience, but you won’t convert nearly as many of them into paying customers as you should have. If all you do is lead generation, you’ll have too small a pool to draw from, and will be constantly trying to attract new leads from people who’ve never heard of&nbsp;you.</p>\n\n\n<p>Generating leads from total strangers takes a lot more work and money than generating leads from people who are at least familiar with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analogy would be like trying to irrigate a field with water from a trickling stream, rather than an abundant river.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation provides the river. Lead generation waters the field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"faqs\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAQs</h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-lead-generation-work-without-prior-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can lead generation work without prior demand&nbsp;generation?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Yes, but it requires a lot more effort, and will usually produce a lot less revenue. With sufficiently targeted marketing, you can create leads from a cold audience. But that target audience, which has to be pre-existing, needs to already be large enough to generate enough quality leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-common-challenges-in-lead-generation-and-how-can-i-overcome them\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are common challenges in lead generation, and how can I overcome&nbsp;them?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Common challenges include not knowing where to look, not having sufficient follow-up marketing, and being timid in making or closing the sale — letting good leads languish on the vine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for knowing where to look, with demand generation marketing, you can build your own audience and then find leads from there. Other than that, look for pre-existing media where your audience already congregates, such as an industry event. Or, use targeted online advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the follow-up problem, you want to create the plan before launching the lead gen campaign. Otherwise, you get a bunch of leads, but you miss the opportunity to convert them. Create a plan and a process for how you will contact your leads. Have a phone script. Have an email welcome series. Send them something in the mail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1.png\" alt=\"Email from Dan-O\" class=\"wp-image-284135\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To inspire confidence in prospects to take action, you must first have confidence in your own ability to sell and the essential role your product or service will play in their lives. For larger companies, it takes a highly-trained sales team and a process that works, and that adapts to the needs of the moment for each prospect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-akismet-help-in-improving-the-quality-of-my-lead-generation efforts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can Akismet help in improving the quality of my lead generation&nbsp;efforts?</h3>\n\n<p>A big part of lead generation is online form submissions. And this is where you run into the annoying problem of bots and scammers filling out your forms. To prevent this, many companies turn to CAPTCHA and other visual puzzles to verify people are humans. But this just passes on the annoyance to your leads. Making them solve puzzles doesn’t set them up to be converted into&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet helps improve lead generation</a> by securing your forms from scammers without forcing your leads to slog through silly puzzles they can’t read and can barely see just to get a hold of your lead magnet or sign up for your free demo or consultation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No puzzles. No roadblocks. And, no spammers. Your forms just work, and it all happens in the background so no one even knows it’s a thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-companies-generally-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of companies generally use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Over 100 million websites currently use Akismet, including<a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\"> enterprise clients</a> such as Microsoft, Bluehost, and ConvertKit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">Here’s more about ConvertKit’s experience</a> with&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about-integrating-akismet-with-my-marketing efforts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about integrating Akismet with my marketing&nbsp;efforts?</h3>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Find out more</a> about how Akismet works in the background to create a zero-friction web form experience for your leads.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordPress Training Team Seeks Ideas to Attract New Learners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=160887\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-training-team-seeks-ideas-to-attract-new-learners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1991:\"<p>The WordPress Training Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/28/drawing-new-learners-to-the-new-learn-wordpress-org/\">currently seeking ideas and feedback</a> from the community to prioritize activities that will increase engagement with the newly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/02/meet-the-new-learn-wordpress/\">revamped Learn WordPress platform</a> and attract new learners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Kathryn Presner stated, “We want to have a steady flow of new learners discovering the site and taking advantage of the valuable resources it offers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has outlined three types of potential activities that the Training Team is considering &#8211;  expanding marketing initiatives, increasing the Training Team’s visibility at WordCamps, and equipping learners and contributors with resources to promote Learn WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community members can go through the list of planned promotional activities, workshops, and events in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/28/drawing-new-learners-to-the-new-learn-wordpress-org/\">Kathryn’s post</a>.

These systems play a critical role in ensuring the security and compliance of IT environments by managing and securing user identities, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining operational efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, implementing and managing digital identity systems is no easy feat. Poor digital identity management can expose organizations to a wide range of risks, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations. These risks can have severe consequences, ranging from financial losses to reputational damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help IT professionals navigate this complex landscape, we&#8217;ve put together a comprehensive guide on digital identity systems. We’ll explain the definition and importance of digital identity systems, along with their key components and benefits. We&#8217;ll also compare leading platforms like Gravatar, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, and OneLogin, examining their features and integration capabilities. Additionally, we&#8217;ll discuss regulatory challenges and technological advancements shaping the future of digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is a digital identity platform?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A digital identity platform is a system designed to manage and verify digital identities within an organization. It plays a vital role in ensuring that the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times, which maintains security and operational efficiency. These platforms help authenticate users, manage their access permissions, and track their activities to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital identity systems are essential in modern IT environments due to the growing need for strict security measures and efficient identity management. With the rise of online security threats and the increasing complexity of regulatory requirements, these systems help organizations stay compliant and secure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While digital identity systems are designed to mitigate risks, they can potentially introduce new challenges if not implemented and managed properly. Improper configuration, weak security measures, or lack of regular updates can create vulnerabilities that malicious actors may exploit. However, these risks are not inherent to the systems themselves but rather stem from how they are deployed and maintained within an organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how to effectively implement and manage digital identity systems while minimizing potential risks, it&#8217;s essential to start with a strong foundation. This includes understanding the structure of digital identity systems, their key components, and how they interact with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin by exploring these fundamental aspects of digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key components of an effective digital identity system&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Identity verification</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">Identity verification</a> is at the core of any digital identity system. It ensures users are who they claim to be and keeps data safe against unauthorized access. Common methods include Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors. For instance, after entering a password, users might also need to enter a code sent to their phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another method is the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/05/09/single-sign-on-solutions/\">Single Sign-On (SSO)</a>, which simplifies the login process by allowing users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. When you combine that with a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/26/revamping-user-authentication-the-role-of-passkeys/\">powerful passkey integration</a>, it significantly reduces password fatigue and improves security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes, which are often used in financial services to verify identities through documentation and background checks, ensuring compliance with regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, role-based access control assigns permissions based on the different roles or job positions within an organization. This means employees have access only to the information and systems necessary for their jobs. For example, a marketing manager might have access to the company’s social media accounts but not the financial records.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strategy like this comes with many benefits:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access by restricting users to predefined roles.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Makes it easier to manage permissions and enforce security policies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improves operational efficiency by streamlining access management.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensures that new employees quickly gain the necessary access without compromising security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removes information clutter allowing users to access only the information they need.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lifecycle management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifecycle management involves overseeing user identities from onboarding to offboarding. This includes creating accounts, assigning roles, configuring permissions, and eventually deactivating accounts when people leave the organization. Effective lifecycle management ensures that user profiles are always up-to-date and secure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, when employees change departments, their access permissions should be adjusted accordingly. This process prevents security gaps arising from outdated or incorrect access rights, reducing the risk of insider threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Auditing and compliance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Auditing and compliance are crucial for monitoring user activities, tracking resource access, and ensuring adherence to security policies and regulations.

Whether you&#8217;re an IT professional, a developer, or a tech enthusiast, join us in discovering how FIDO passkeys are shaping the future of secure online authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is FIDO? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed by the <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FIDO Alliance</a>, Fast Identity Online (FIDO) represents a groundbreaking initiative aimed at redefining online security. It’s a set of security specifications that significantly reduce our reliance on passwords, introducing a more secure and user-friendly method of authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of FIDO&#8217;s approach is the concept of local authentication. Instead of sending your password across the internet where it could be intercepted, FIDO performs the authentication on your device. This method is much more secure and enhances privacy by ensuring your unique credentials never leave your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging cryptographic keys, FIDO allows users to prove their identity online without revealing sensitive information. This innovative approach makes it much harder for hackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts, as they can&#8217;t simply steal a password. Instead, they would need physical access to the user&#8217;s device, a significantly higher barrier to breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How FIDO passkeys revolutionize user security with public key cryptography</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>FIDO passkeys’ architecture is built around a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key stored on the service provider’s server, and a private key securely kept on the user’s device. This design ensures that authentication happens locally, making it significantly more secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how it works:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Registration:</strong> To start using a FIDO passkey, users first need to access the service they want to use it with. This typically involves verifying your identity through an existing method (like a password or an email link) and then initiating the passkey creation. Users begin by registering with a service, where their device creates a new pair of cryptographic keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"2288\" height=\"1145\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/registration-process-iag.png\" alt=\"Registration process with FIDO passkeys\" class=\"wp-image-1723\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storing: </strong>The public key is safely stored on the service’s server, while the private key remains secured on the device. The server associates the public key with your account. Your device is now “bound” to your account using this passkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Authentication:</strong> When users want to log in, the service will ask for the passkey by sending a challenge to their device. Sometimes (depending on the configuration), the users will need to verify their identity to unlock the private key stored on their device to sign the challenge. Successful decryption and response to the challenge verify the user’s identity without transmitting any secret information or the private key itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"2289\" height=\"1458\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sign-in_iag.png\" alt=\"Sign-in process with FIDO passkeys\" class=\"wp-image-1726\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are many advantages to FIDO Passkeys:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enhanced security: </strong>By verifying the user locally, FIDO keeps users and devices safe against phishing, brute force attacks, and other cyber threats.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User convenience: </strong>Simplifies the login process for users, eliminating the need to remember and manage complex passwords.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heightened user trust:</strong> Increases confidence in the platform’s security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduction in data breaches: </strong>Minimizes risks associated with password theft.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost savings: </strong>Lowers the financial impact related to security breaches and <a href=\"https://www.keepersecurity.com/en_GB/resources/cost-of-a-helpdesk-password-reset/\" rel=\"nofollow\">password resets</a>, which can add up to thousands or millions of dollars per year, depending on the size of the organization.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Universal compatibility: </strong>FIDO passkeys can be integrated into a wide range of devices and platforms, allowing users to enjoy advanced security without the need for additional hardware.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability and versatility: </strong>FIDO passkeys are adaptable, capable of being deployed across numerous industries, such as finance and e-commerce, and compatible with various platforms, including web and mobile applications.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how FIDO Passkeys compare to traditional authentication methods:</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Feature</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>FIDO Passkeys</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Traditional Authentication</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Authentication Method</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Two-factor, biometric verification</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Password-based</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Security Level</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">High, due to local authentication</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Lower, prone to breaches</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>User Convenience</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">High, no passwords needed</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">Low, due to the necessity of password management</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The role of WebAuthn and CTAP in enabling FIDO passkeys</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Authentication (WebAuthn) and Client To Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) standards are what help platforms and services adopt FIDO passkeys in their systems. These protocols work together to ensure a user-friendly and secure authentication experience across various devices and platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WebAuthn at a glance</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webauthn.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WebAuthn</a> defines an API for creating and using strong authentication credentials on the web. It enables users to log in via biometrics, mobile devices, or FIDO security keys, enhancing the security of online interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WebAuthn is designed to work alongside traditional passwords, offering a layer of multi-factor authentication (MFA) that significantly boosts security without compromising convenience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major browsers like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mozilla Firefox</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Edge</a> have embraced WebAuthn, signaling its growing acceptance as the standard for web authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CTAP: Bridging devices and authenticators</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.2-rd-20230321/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.2-rd-20230321.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CTAP</a> complements WebAuthn by adding the option to use external devices such as mobile phones or security keys as authenticators. This protocol is also very important for enabling FIDO passkeys to function across different platforms, allowing for a more integrated and secure authentication process. CTAP is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), where an additional layer of security is crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CTAP is often used in high-risk sectors like banking and healthcare, where the integrity of user authentication processes is critical. In these environments, CTAP&#8217;s role in 2FA is vital, offering an extra security measure that protects sensitive data and user identities from potential threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensuring compatibility: Using passkeys across devices and platforms</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>FIDO passkeys seamlessly integrate with major operating systems, including <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/\" rel=\"nofollow\">macOS</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linux.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linux</a>, as well as mobile platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.android.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android</a>. This widespread compatibility means users can enjoy the benefits of passkeys, such as enhanced security and convenience, on virtually any device they own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use FIDO passkeys on virtually any browser, including Chrome, Firefox, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/safari/\">Safari</a>, and Edge because they fully support WebAuthn and CTAP protocols. While these browsers are committed to implementing these standards, there might be some variations in support levels, so you need to pay attention to ongoing updates and adjust as needed to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to properly integrate FIDO passkeys, platforms and services need to implement the WebAuthn API and potentially adapt to the latest versions of CTAP. If you’re a developer or an IT professional, we recommend that you stay informed about these evolving standards to ensure compatibility and maximize security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the broad support for FIDO passkeys, challenges still exist, such as discrepancies in protocol implementations across different platforms or browsers. Thankfully, there is a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/fidoalliance.org/g/fido-dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">very active FIDO dev community</a> that people can turn to at any point and try to resolve technical issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that besides all the software, you also have hardware authenticators, like <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/products/\" rel=\"nofollow\">YubiKeys</a>, that enhance the FIDO passkey ecosystem by providing a physical device that stores cryptographic credentials. These devices are compatible with a wide range of operating systems and platforms, offering an additional layer of security, especially in environments where mobile devices are not allowed or practical.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gravatar: Your digital identity management companion in a passkeys world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you passionate about passkeys and eager for a world where passwords no longer exist? We are too! Passkeys, including those built on FIDO standards, are a huge step forward in creating a better internet for the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not the only step forward. If you’re looking into implementing FIDO passkeys on your website or web app, go the extra mile and build a truly robust and complete digital identity management system with <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, an <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> service, is a profile management system that allows people to create Gravatar profiles linked to their email addresses, which they can carry across various apps and platforms such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Slack</a>, and <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the combination of Gravatar and FIDO, you can significantly improve the onboarding process and user experience by allowing people to effortlessly sign up and sign in to your platform without the hassle of remembering multiple passwords.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? A quick and easy sign-up process that saves time, making it a win-win for both users and service providers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, you can use Gravatar&#8217;s API to offer personalized, secure, and privacy-preserving user experiences on your platform.&nbsp;If you want to learn more about how Gravatar can elevate your user experience and security, <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\">check out our documentation and subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 16:00:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Gravatar: 10 Proven Strategies for Engaging Users: App Onboarding 101\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=2111\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/09/03/app-onboarding/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27834:\"<p>Have you ever downloaded an app only to feel lost and frustrated within the first few minutes? That&#8217;s where app onboarding comes in. It&#8217;s the digital equivalent of a warm welcome and a guided tour, all rolled into one user-friendly experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, app onboarding is the process of introducing new users to your app&#8217;s interface, features, and benefits. A well-crafted onboarding experience can make the difference between a user who sticks around and one who hits the dreaded uninstall button. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: <strong>effective onboarding isn&#8217;t just about showing off your app&#8217;s bells and whistles</strong>. It&#8217;s about helping users understand how your app can solve their problems or make their lives easier. Get it right, and you&#8217;ll see higher user satisfaction, increased engagement, and, ultimately, better retention rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we share the top strategies for creating an onboarding experience that will wow your users and keep them coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why app onboarding is different from web onboarding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Onboarding is onboarding, right?&#8221; – think again. Mobile app onboarding is a whole different ball game compared to its web counterpart. Here’s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>User engagement and time constraints</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile users are like hummingbirds – always on the move and easily distracted. They&#8217;re scrolling through apps while waiting for coffee, during commutes, or in between Netflix episodes. This means you&#8217;ve got a smaller window to capture and keep their attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With web onboarding, users might be willing to sit through a longer introduction. But for mobile? <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36256-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research shows</a> that you need to be quick, concise, and to the point. It&#8217;s all about delivering maximum value in minimum time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technical constraints and opportunities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile devices come with their own set of challenges and perks. Smaller screens mean you need to be smart about how you present information. Every pixel counts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not all limitations. Mobile apps can tap into device-specific features like push notifications, geolocation, and camera access. These can be powerful tools for creating a more immersive and personalized onboarding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Consistency across platforms</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where things get tricky. If your app has both mobile and web versions, you need to walk a fine line. The onboarding experience should feel consistent across platforms while still playing to the strengths of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it as like translating a book into different languages. The core story stays the same, but you might need to tweak certain elements to make it resonate with each audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Top strategies for an engaging app onboarding process</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to take your app onboarding from good to great? Let&#8217;s dive into some strategies that&#8217;ll have your users saying &#8220;wow&#8221; from the get-go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Choose your onboarding strategy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first – you need to pick the right onboarding strategy. You want to make a great impression, but you also want to be true to your app&#8217;s personality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three popular strategies:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Progressive onboarding</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; of the onboarding world. Instead of bombarding users with information, you introduce features gradually as they explore the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prevents information overload.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allows users to learn by doing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keeps users engaged by revealing features at just the right moment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use tooltips to guide users through features step-by-step.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add gamification elements like progress bars to keep users motivated.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep instructions short and sweet – think bite-sized nuggets of info.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Function-oriented onboarding</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy focuses on teaching users how to use your app&#8217;s core features right off the bat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gets users up to speed quickly on essential features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helps users achieve their goals faster.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduces the learning curve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create interactive tutorials for key functions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use video guides or animations to show features in action.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Let users practice in a safe sandbox environment before diving in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Benefits-oriented onboarding</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is all about showing users what&#8217;s in it for them. It&#8217;s like answering the question, &#8220;Why should I care about this app?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helps users understand your app&#8217;s unique value proposition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Motivates users by showing them what they can achieve.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increases retention by aligning your app&#8217;s value with user needs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use welcome screens to showcase key benefits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include user testimonials or success stories.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personalize content to highlight features that align with user goals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Include key onboarding elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve chosen your strategy let&#8217;s talk about the essential elements of a killer onboarding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sign-up page</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your app&#8217;s front door. Make it welcoming and easy to walk through, focusing on clear instructions and encouraging users to finish the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep it simple – ask for only essential information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Consider offering social media login options.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make it visually appealing with a clean design and clear call-to-action buttons.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Welcome screen</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your app&#8217;s first impression so make sure it’s inviting, informative, and it includes a brief overview of the app&#8217;s benefits and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use a friendly, welcoming tone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight key benefits and features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personalize the message if possible (e.g., &#8220;Hi Sarah, welcome to [App Name]!&#8221;).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interactive walkthrough</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, you need to guide users through your app&#8217;s features in a way that&#8217;s engaging and educational. You can even make it into a game-like experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Break complex features into simple, digestible steps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use tooltips, pop-ups, and animations to guide users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make it interactive – let users try features as they learn about them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Feature guidance</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Help users understand and use your app&#8217;s core features effectively. The faster they get to this point, the more they will get out of using your app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use tooltips to provide contextual help.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer short, focused tutorials for key features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide on-demand help that users can access when they need it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-serve support</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Empower users to find answers on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create a comprehensive knowledge base with articles, FAQs, and video tutorials that users can access anytime.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure your help section is searchable and includes logical categories so it’s easy to navigate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Consider adding a community forum where users can help each other.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strike a balance: </strong>You want to provide enough guidance to help users get started but not so much that they feel overwhelmed or hand-held. It&#8217;s all about empowering your users to explore and discover the value of your app on their own terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Adapt the onboarding process length to your users</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to app onboarding, there are conflicting opinions about whether it’s a better idea to keep it short and sweet or not. While most people seem to be rushing to get to that “first value”, some experiments show that longer onboarding processes <a href=\"https://www.innertrends.com/blog/onboarding-is-it-a-good-idea-to-get-to-first-value-a-s-a-p\" rel=\"nofollow\">lead to higher conversion and retention rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that just like anything else, a balanced approach is needed – it all comes down to context. Think about your target audience and tailor the process to their requirements. For example, if you have a music app, like <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify</a>, the user’s main goal is to just listen to music, so a lengthy onboarding process doesn’t really make sense. You can add a step where they can select their favorite genres and artists, but beyond that, you’re just making it hard for them to start using your app as intended.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you have a fitness app that offers personalized workouts, you’ll probably need a lot more information from your users such as their fitness goals, current weight and possibilities, exercises they can’t or don’t want to do, number of sessions per week, whether they live in an apartment and need to be quiet or they go to the gym and have access to a lot of equipment, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your case is, there are some universal rules that help make the onboarding uncluttered, which should be the goal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Minimize the number of steps:</strong> Think &#8220;need to know&#8221; vs &#8220;nice to know.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use progressive disclosure:</strong> Reveal features gradually as users need them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make non-essential steps skippable: </strong>Let users decide what they want to learn.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Gravatar integration helps reduce sign-up times</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1473\" height=\"918\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravatar-profiles-as-a-service-1.png\" alt=\"Gravatar – Profiles as a Service\" class=\"wp-image-2114\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, short for Globally Recognized Avatar, is a tool that allows people to create consistent <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">digital identities</a> with the same profile picture and basic information across multiple platforms, all linked to their email addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an app developer, you can <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/\">use the Gravatar REST API</a> to create a personalized experience for each user. This means that users can quickly sign up using their existing Gravatar profile, which automatically populates their profile picture and basic info. No more tedious form-filling!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Collect user data at initial stages</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collecting user data early on helps you tailor the experience to their preferences and needs, and when you do that, you can enjoy:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personalization through customized content and recommendations</strong>, making your app more relevant to each user.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved retention</strong> because personalized experiences can lead to higher user satisfaction and retention rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Efficiency in operations</strong> thanks to early data collection, making your app more intuitive and user-friendly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the catch – you need to strike a balance between collecting necessary information and not overwhelming the user. It&#8217;s like asking for someone&#8217;s life story on a first date – it&#8217;s too much, too soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also where you can use the Gravatar integration to its full potential. Users can import their name, email, and profile picture from their Gravatar account with just a click because the API will pull this verified information directly from the user&#8217;s profile. This method significantly reduces the risk of errors and friction, so you can increase completion rates and improve user engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it’s a great way of preventing fake accounts – users are more likely to use their real identities when importing existing profile information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Create skippable elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps in similar niches tend to look and work in familiar ways (project management apps, for example), so if your users are more knowledgeable, they probably won’t need to go through the entire process similar to a complete beginner. This is why it’s always a good idea to add a skip button during the different stages and allow users to control the process based on their preferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tactic:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Respects your users’ time:</strong> Some users might already be familiar with similar apps and don&#8217;t need a full tutorial.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoids redundancy:</strong> Forcing people through unnecessary steps can lead to frustration and abandonment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Empowers users: </strong>Having control over the learning process can increase engagement and satisfaction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Always provide a clear and visible option to skip onboarding steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Utilize a progress bar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Progress bars are the best way to give users a sense of how far they&#8217;ve come and how much is left to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They bring:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Visual representation: </strong>They provide a clear visual of the onboarding process, helping users understand their progress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Psychological benefits: </strong>They create a sense of accomplishment and reduce anxiety, which can increase user engagement and completion rates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Set expectations: </strong>By showing the number of steps involved, progress bars help users know what to expect from the onboarding process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/\" rel=\"nofollow\">study by the Nielsen Norman Group</a> showed that progress bars can significantly improve user engagement. It&#8217;s like the difference between running a marathon with or without mile markers – knowing how far you&#8217;ve come can be a powerful motivator.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Utilize onboarding checklists</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Checklists aren&#8217;t just for grocery shopping or packing for vacation. For app onboarding, they&#8217;re a powerful tool to ensure users complete essential steps and get the most out of your app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why checklists rock:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Track progress: </strong>They help users keep track of what they&#8217;ve done and what&#8217;s left to do.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Provide structure:</strong> Checklists break down the onboarding process into manageable steps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Psychological benefits: </strong>There&#8217;s something satisfying about checking off items on a list. It provides a sense of accomplishment and can motivate users to complete the onboarding process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of onboarding checklists as a gentle guide, not a strict rulebook. They should help users navigate your app, not make them feel like they&#8217;re taking a test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Use push notifications strategically</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When used correctly, push notifications can guide, motivate, and engage users throughout their onboarding journey and beyond. But beware: <strong>poorly timed or irrelevant notifications can put users off and even lead them to uninstall.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to make push notifications work for you with some fictional examples from famous apps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Welcome messages: </strong>Start on the right foot with a warm greeting. A language learning app might send something like: &#8220;<em>Bienvenue! Ready to start your French adventure?</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Event-triggered notifications:</strong> Respond to users&#8217; real-time behavior to keep them engaged. If you have a sports app, you can encourage users who have been active throughout the day and maybe offer them some stretching exercises.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Onboarding completion reminders:</strong> Gently nudge users to finish setting up their profiles. For example, LinkedIn often sends notifications like &#8220;<em>Your profile is 70% complete. Add your skills to stand out to recruiters!</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Milestone celebrations:</strong> Acknowledge user progress to boost motivation. Duolingo is very famous just for that and gives its users all sorts of milestones to celebrate, such as learning streaks.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-streak.png?w=660\" alt=\"Duolingo 1-day streak milestone\" class=\"wp-image-2115\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Personalized tips:</strong> Offer advice based on user behavior. A meditation app might notice a lot of phone activity in times when the device would usually be turned off and send a message saying: &#8220;<em>Having trouble sleeping? Try our new &#8216;Deep Sleep&#8217; story tonight at 10 PM.</em>&#8220;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, always give users control over their notification settings. Nothing turns people off faster than feeling bombarded with messages they can&#8217;t opt out of. Respect their preferences, and they&#8217;re more likely to stay engaged with your app in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Employ regular user testing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but definitely not least, don&#8217;t forget about user testing. It&#8217;s like having a focus group for your app, helping you identify pain points and optimize the onboarding flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why user testing is so important:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Identify issues:</strong> It helps you spot problems in the onboarding process that you might have overlooked.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gather feedback: </strong>Get actionable insights directly from your target users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continuous improvement: </strong>Regular testing allows you to refine and enhance the onboarding experience over time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different ways to conduct user testing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Moderated testing:</strong> Watch users interact with your app in real time and ask questions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unmoderated testing:</strong> Users complete tasks on their own and provide feedback.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A/B testing:</strong> Compare different versions of your onboarding process to see which performs better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Beta testing: </strong>Release your app to a small group of users before the official launch to gather feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, user testing isn&#8217;t a one-and-done deal. It&#8217;s an ongoing process that helps you keep your onboarding experience fresh, relevant, and effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of apps with great onboarding flows</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some apps that have nailed the onboarding process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duolingo</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Duolingo homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2116\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duolingo</a>, the popular language learning app, has mastered the art of engaging onboarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fun and engaging:</strong> Duolingo turns the necessary information gathering into a fun, game-like experience. It doesn&#8217;t feel like a chore – it feels like the start of an adventure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-onboarding-example.png?w=660\" alt=\"Duolingo onboarding question – Choose a language \" class=\"wp-image-2127\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Gamification:</strong> The app uses elements like rewards, progress tracking, and interactive lessons to keep users motivated from the get-go.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Personalization:</strong> By asking about language proficiency and learning goals, Duolingo tailors the experience to each user&#8217;s needs (and they include a cool progress bar!).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-micro-survey.png?w=660\" alt=\"Duolingo questionnaire \" class=\"wp-image-2128\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Immediate value:</strong> Users start learning right away, experiencing the app&#8217;s core value proposition from the first interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TikTok</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/tiktok-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"TikTok homepage with a MrBeast video\" class=\"wp-image-2118\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TikTok</a>&#8216;s onboarding is all about getting users hooked on content as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Quick time-to-value:</strong> Users can start watching and swiping through videos without even signing up.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Minimal friction:</strong> TikTok delays the sign-up process until users are already engaged with the content.

Remember, the key is to make it easy, engaging, and valuable right from the start. Your onboarding should be like a good handshake – firm, friendly, and not too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground in this article, from choosing the right onboarding strategy to leveraging tools like progress bars and checklists. But here&#8217;s a pro tip that ties it all together: <strong>consider integrating Gravatar into your onboarding process</strong>. It&#8217;s like having a universal ID for the internet, making sign-ups a breeze, and helping you collect key user data right off the bat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar integration is easier than you might think, and it can significantly streamline your onboarding process. By allowing users to import their existing profile information, you&#8217;re not just saving them time – you&#8217;re also ensuring accuracy and consistency in user data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to take your app onboarding to the next level? <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\">Dive deeper into Gravatar integration</a> and discover how it can transform your user experience.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 15:50:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WordPress.org blog: WordCamp US 2024: Oregon-a See You There?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17653\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wordcamp-us-2024-oregon-a-see-you-there/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4619:\"<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp US 2024</a> rounds out this year’s trio of flagship WordCamps.

Welcome to another BizChat on Do the Woo. My name is Marcus Burnette, and I&#8217;m a community marketer with GoDaddy. I&#8217;m here today, as always, with my wonderful co-host from Barn2 Plugins, Katie Keith, and we&#8217;ve roped in the man behind the curtain himself, Bob Dunn. How are you both doing today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;m good, thanks. Good to talk to you, and very exciting to have Bob on as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />They let me out of my cage, so it&#8217;s great to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Got to join us every once in a while. Well, we&#8217;re going to be chatting about the WordCamp experience with us coming up and how to make the most of your time and money as a business, whether you&#8217;re attending, sponsoring, or maybe even watching from afar. We can talk about that as well. I was going to say, maybe to start, we&#8217;ll assume for the purposes of this conversation that people know what a WordCamp is and have decided to bring their business. So we&#8217;ll kind of start with that baseline and talk a little bit about just maximizing the time, maximizing the spend, and all of that. How does that sound to you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, that sounds good. Should be interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yep. Awesome. I guess I&#8217;ll just kick it off for all of us to chat about WordCamp as a concept, as a group of sessions, and there are sponsors and there are parties and all of that stuff. How do you balance what to attend, especially when it comes to sessions? There are a lot to choose from, with multiple tracks. How do you pick and choose what makes the most sense to attend at a WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s easy to feel quite torn in many different directions. At the big WordCamps, you&#8217;ve got multiple tracks running alongside each other, and then, of course, all the time there is the hallway track as well. So you need to look at the schedule and think of those maybe four different things—three tracks plus the general networking. Oh, and the sponsor hall, so you could argue that&#8217;s five. Which of those do you do at any given moment? And then, in addition, you&#8217;ve got all the parties. I remember when I started going to WordCamps, it was really just like the after party, but now I think every WordCamp I go to, there are more side events being organized of all different scales by many different companies of different sizes, and a lot of those are open to everybody to register. And I think, in WordCamp Europe this year, there were probably three or four parties running in the same building simultaneously on the first night of the conference. So it was like going between different parties and ethical dilemmas of not being able to attend one after taking a place by registering. So it is a fine juggling act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. I think, especially for anybody new, it is finding that right balance and not totally being worn out by the end of day one or something. It&#8217;s a bit challenging, and you probably want some downtime too, so I think that&#8217;s important. Some of us fill up our cards—or dance cards, per se—and we&#8217;re going from one place to another. I think the sessions are really nice in the sense that not only are they great educationally, but for people that need a little bit of downtime to get out of the social atmosphere, they can just maybe sit and relax. A session is great because you can sit there, you can enjoy, you can learn. So there&#8217;s a lot of stuff. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t make most of the sessions, but I do fill up the side events. I fill up the card on that. I try not to overlap too much where I disappoint somebody if I&#8217;m taking a spot. I don&#8217;t want to be doing that, but yeah, it&#8217;s a hard thing to really… Sometimes it&#8217;s that experience the first time. You&#8217;ve got to see how it goes, and from there on, you start to get what works for you and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. A lot of advice I&#8217;ve heard from people is that the sessions will almost always end up online for you to watch later, so skip them and go network. Do you think that is solid advice? Do you think there&#8217;s a worthwhile reason to look at the schedule and find sessions that you probably should attend? You don&#8217;t have the opportunity to ask questions of a speaker necessarily if you&#8217;re watching it later, where you might be able to ask questions during the session. Do you think it&#8217;s worth it? I guess the question is, is that good advice, or should people still look at the schedule and find time to at least attend a few sessions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I feel a bit torn because I recently was a speaker for the first time, but generally, sessions are not an important part of a WordCamp for me. They cover things that you can access at any time of the year, either by reading blog posts or eBooks or real books or listening to podcasts like this. There&#8217;s information, the same as what you get in talks, wherever you look these days. It&#8217;s really excellent how much the WordPress community produces that you can learn from. And then, as you said, Marcus, you can watch things later. There is sort of something to be said for going in person, but I feel that&#8217;s a missed opportunity, and I love what Bob said about it being a kind of break. I go to sessions for an introvert break, and I might learn something, but yeah, that&#8217;s track six. I said there were four or five tracks, and the introvert track is the other one, which might be a wellness room. For me, it&#8217;s often just going back to my hotel room for half an hour for that reason. Actually, I like to stay at the venue if it&#8217;s a hotel where possible because you can just go if you need a bit of a break and then come back down into the thick of it. But I find that the networking, both with people I already know and people I haven&#8217;t met yet, is the most valuable part of attending a WordCamp, and the sessions, therefore, aren&#8217;t as important unless I need a break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />I think that it&#8217;s, again, what you&#8217;re going there for. And I think maybe saying it in the way of that they are online, so being aware that they&#8217;re online if something happens, if you cannot make it, or you get into a conversation you don&#8217;t want to end. That&#8217;s a great alternative because you do have that option. But like Katie said, I think there&#8217;s also some people too that they like to immerse themselves in the actual room, listening to it versus doing it online. So I think it&#8217;s a recommendation more than a suggestion like, &#8220;Hey, you can go there, but if you can&#8217;t make every session, they are online.&#8221; And like you said, everybody&#8217;s going to make their choice. Sometimes I feel really bad when somebody asks me, &#8220;Oh, did you come and see my session?&#8221; And then you fall back, &#8220;Oh, well, I will catch up online.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I do go to sessions if it&#8217;s somebody I know because I&#8217;m supporting them. And it&#8217;s sort of different motivation, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, that makes sense. But it also becomes harder and harder as you get to know more and more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />True, true. We do know a lot of speakers by now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. And you mentioned that you recently were able to be a speaker. One of my questions I had for you, and I&#8217;ll ask Bob too because he&#8217;s been a speaker, do you feel like there&#8217;s a strong business case for applying to speak? Did you feel like, I guess, did you feel like that was worthwhile for your business? Did you do that because you wanted to have that as an accolade, as something that you&#8217;ve done under your belt? Personally, I guess just, and then talking about whether or not people are even attending sessions, is there a good business case for applying and being accepted to speak and being a speaker at a WordCamp event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Well, it&#8217;s interesting because I didn&#8217;t particularly want to be a speaker, so I do the WP Product Talk podcast with Matt Cromwell and two other people, but Matt particularly invited me to apply with him, and I kind of just said yes without really thinking about it or whether I actually wanted to. I just thought, &#8220;Yeah, that would help promote the podcast. Let&#8217;s go for it.&#8221; And then we were accepted, and I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve never spoken to a big group. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m comfortable with this,&#8221; but I wasn&#8217;t going to drop out or anything. So I did lots of practicing, and it went really well. But reflecting on it afterward, actually, I realized that it was valuable to the business to be a speaker, and particularly in comparison with sponsoring. And I know I upset a few people, which I regret afterward because I tweeted or something that having sponsored the previous year and then being a speaker the following year, I felt that my company had similar exposure from the two things. Also, there were six of my team members walking around in the bright Barn2 T-shirts, and that plus being a speaker and I was on a discussion panel. I tweeted that I felt maybe Barn2 had as much exposure from that as sponsoring. And then lots of people quite rightly got upset that we need to be encouraging people to sponsor and not saying it&#8217;s not necessary. So I would say they are different ways of achieving exposure for your company. Sponsoring is one way, which undeniably does that. But yes, being a speaker does help you get exposure, particularly if you can think of a topic to talk about, which is in some way not directly promotional but is</p>\n\n\n\n<p>relevant to what you do. Because I was talking about how to build a product company, which has nothing to do with the plugins that I sell. So if you can think of something a bit more relevant—if you sell WooCommerce extensions, your talk can be about WooCommerce to help you position yourself as an expert in that field—particularly then I think that could possibly help with sales. Maybe not in the short term, but in the long term, people would recognize you and your company more and be more likely to become a customer. So I would say that there is a business benefit of being a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;d argue that talking about building a product company is relevant in the sense that I like to know who I&#8217;m buying products from, and so knowing you and your company better would be good for business overall. And we&#8217;ll talk about the sponsorship piece in a moment, but I want to give Bob a chance too. Bob, I know your business is a little bit different. You&#8217;re not a product company or an agency, although you&#8217;ve done both of those things too, I believe. Do you feel like there&#8217;s a business case to speaking? Is it just exposure, or is it part of the long-term game—the long game of hoping that people recognize you and want to purchase from you down the line? Or is there maybe a more direct business case for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, I think that… I wish I could remember my first time speaking. I need to go to a site that will tell me that, which we&#8217;re all familiar with—Marcus&#8217;s site. But yeah, so it was early. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s 2011, 12, 13 when I did it, and yeah, I forced myself to do it because, at that point, I wasn&#8217;t really into speaking to large groups. I tried to do it at a few other conferences too, but it was personal branding for me. I was doing a lot of training back then, blogging—that was it—basically a lot of training. And for me, it was a good way to brand myself because, obviously, what I talked about was what I talked about in my tutorials or my videos or whatever. So it was certainly something I did for a few years. Then there came a point where I didn&#8217;t really necessarily feel like I didn&#8217;t want to brand myself or continue to brand myself, but I just got to the point where I thought, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m done speaking at WordCamps.&#8221; And I think that decision partly came too because I&#8217;d done it for a few years and so many people apply to those, and I thought, &#8220;Why am I continuing to take up the space there?&#8221; And so I kind of stepped back, and I prefer not speaking now. I enjoy going to WordCamps, but I would encourage anybody to do it and see how it works for you too, personally. It&#8217;s not always the easiest thing for a lot of people to do—to get up and stand in front of a crowd like that. But I&#8217;ve talked to many people who have been very stressed. I&#8217;ll just divert to a little short story. Years ago, I was at a WordCamp, a local WordCamp. There was a guy sitting on the floor, and I&#8217;m not going to mention him, but he&#8217;s very known in the WordPress space. But he was sitting on the floor by himself, and I asked him what was wrong. He looked a little stressed. He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m speaking for the very first time, and I don&#8217;t think I should have done this.&#8221; So I sat down on the floor next to him. We just started talking. I said, &#8220;People are pretty forgiving,&#8221; and this was quite a few years ago, but I think they still are. I said, &#8220;Go in there, do your thing.&#8221; And eventually, he did. I don&#8217;t know if I really made him feel any better about it, but afterward, somebody did come up to me and, without even asking them, they said, &#8220;Hey, the guy was a little nervous, but boy, the information was great. He did a really good job.&#8221; So I went back and told him. I thought he should hear that, and he did smile. He said, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s great to know.&#8221; But yeah, it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve got to… For a lot of people, you make yourself do it, but I think it&#8217;s, again, it really depends on the person and if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re comfortable with and if you feel you really want to build that brand, whether it&#8217;s your company&#8217;s brand or your personal brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, if your profile is up to date fully, your first talk was in 2011 at WordCamp Seattle, so, oh wow, been a little bit, but you&#8217;ve spoken plenty of times since then. Yeah, I spoke as well last year, I think it was, at WordCamp Phoenix, and I appreciated, I guess, the exposure. I appreciated the way that it opened up opportunities for people to ask you questions. I think that was more beneficial than most anything else was. Now you&#8217;re a name on the sheet and a face that people have seen that, for better or for worse, makes you an expert in at least the topic that you were talking about, but also by the nature of it, a WordPress expert in the WordPress expert circle. And so it gives opportunities for you to have people approach you and ask questions and say, &#8220;I want to learn more about X, Y, Z.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re a business, that opens up doors for you to talk about, like Katie was saying, if your talk was about something related to your business, there&#8217;s obviously an open door there to then talk about some of the products or services that you sell as well—to say, &#8220;Hey, I understand that problem. I&#8217;ve come across it lots of times. We&#8217;ve actually built a product that helps with that problem. Let me tell you about it.&#8221; And the sales process kind of comes to you a little bit in that regard, and I think that&#8217;s helpful as well. It is something that you have to apply and be accepted for. So let&#8217;s talk about the other direction, which is sponsorship, which you pay into as a business. You can also pay to be a sponsor. That guarantees you a spot in the sponsor hall, whatever that may look like. It&#8217;s a little different based on the size of the conference, but that gets you guaranteed access to attendees to talk a little bit about what you do. I don&#8217;t want to open the controversy box again with Katie there on whether you should or shouldn&#8217;t, but maybe we can talk a little bit about the business case for sponsoring a little bit and what do you get? I know that Katie, you&#8217;ve sponsored in the past. Bob, I know that you&#8217;ve sponsored in the past. I&#8217;m part of the GoDaddy team that sponsors globally all of the WordCamps, so maybe we can chat just a little bit about the business case for sponsoring WordCamp events. We&#8217;ll start with you, Katie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think we can all agree, and this is well-documented now, that sponsoring does not generate enough direct sales in the short term to cover the cost of sponsorship. However, there are still other benefits, particularly if you have the kind of marketing strategy and accompanying budget where you are going for general brand awareness within the WordPress community, which, for example, hosting companies—that&#8217;s very important that they&#8217;re seen to be big players, support the community, and so on. Being there has a symbolic importance, as well as directly getting people to know your brand over time. So I think there are benefits, but you shouldn&#8217;t sponsor a WordCamp if you think it&#8217;s going to generate more sales than it costs straight away and that you&#8217;ll be able to measure that. Last year, when I sponsored for the first time, I did a sale—a 50% off sale—and gave everybody leaflets with coupon codes, and we made literally zero sales from that. And I know because nobody used that coupon; I can track that. So it is not a direct ROI, but people must be more familiar with our brand. Hundreds and hundreds of people talked to us over the two days. We did product demos. Existing customers asked questions which might have helped to boost their loyalty over time and their likelihood of being retained and renewing. There are lots of indirect benefits, but you&#8217;re never going to measure them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Do the Woo sponsored, and actually several people came up to me and asked me, &#8220;Why are you sponsoring?&#8221; They couldn&#8217;t quite understand it because I am not selling a product. I&#8217;m basically saying, &#8220;Hey, come and listen to our shows.&#8221; And I thought about it long and hard. I had a little experience with being able to take over a booth at WordCamp US last year. So then, after that experience, I decided to try WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe. And one thing is, yeah, your expectations—you&#8217;ve got to understand what to expect and can this bring enough value to you for brand awareness? And that was one big part of it, to make people aware of the podcasts. I&#8217;d also… It&#8217;s easy to say, &#8220;Hey, go spend whatever amount of money out there you need to spend to be a sponsor.&#8221; But I also had my sponsors. I talked to them about me sponsoring at least a couple of the flagship sponsorships, so I got that money through my sponsorships where I could sponsor, which is kind of meta. But anyway, it was incredibly valuable for me because of not just being a podcast but being what the podcast stands for within the community. I mean, it became more of a community table. I know that Katie was able to spend some time at it, and people would just come up and talk about things. They don&#8217;t always need to talk about a podcast show. Katie was catching people she maybe hadn&#8217;t seen yet because we were in a very nice location, especially at WordCamp Europe, where people were passing by. And I had several</p>\n\n\n\n<p>people later on say, &#8220;Hey, I was going to stop by and say hi, but there were so many people around your booth that I just thought, well, maybe I can catch you another time.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;We just saw you constantly busy,&#8221; and it wasn&#8217;t necessarily, again, selling or talking about the podcast endlessly, but when somebody would be able to come up and say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s your podcast about?&#8221; I had all these stickers out for the different shows, and so I&#8217;d get talking to them. I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Well, what do you do?&#8221; I&#8217;d give them the sticker of the show that I thought fit them because they maybe wouldn&#8217;t want to listen to them all. So it was a very good investment for me and a good investment for the growth. I think Katie said something like, &#8220;If you can find the right strategy and you find the value and the value equals what you have to spend,&#8221; especially in the case of Katie or GoDaddy. I mean, I set myself up, and I was basically it, and then some of the hosts were there. But you&#8217;ve got a team that you&#8217;ve got to fly there or whatever. You&#8217;ve got a team that you&#8217;ve got to put in the hotels, feed, all this stuff. So there&#8217;s a lot of added expense besides just that dollar amount you&#8217;re looking at for the sponsorship. So it&#8217;s a good value if you know what you&#8217;re getting into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />For something like WordCamp US, I don&#8217;t even want to talk about the amount of money that GoDaddy spends to sponsor and have team members and all of that there. And the ROI is impossible to either track long-term or make up in immediate sales. WordCamps are generally not sales events. We aren&#8217;t salesy. When people come up to the booth, we&#8217;re happy to talk about the things that we&#8217;re doing with WordPress and GoDaddy and share as much information as people are interested in listening to, but it&#8217;s not a sales event. We all kind of know that, and so making that up is nearly impossible. That being said, and we could probably do an entire episode—or I think maybe we even have done an episode—about why or why not to sponsor, there&#8217;s another part to sponsoring WordCamp in the sense that one of the big reasons that we&#8217;re global sponsors and continue to be large sponsors at flagship events is just to show the community that we&#8217;re here and invested in the community. There&#8217;s clearly an investment cost there that isn&#8217;t recouped in sales. That is just us saying, &#8220;We want to see this project, this ecosystem, this community succeed. We&#8217;re going to put our dollars behind it and show up and show up big and have lots of people come with us to meet the community and be part of the community and contribute, to be part of Contributor Day and all of that stuff.&#8221; That being said, I also wonder kind of the flip side that I always ask myself and ask people when we start to talk about whether we should or shouldn&#8217;t be at any particular WordCamp is: is there a cost to not being at a WordCamp? We&#8217;ve clearly discussed not financial, but kind of like a reputation cost. Does showing up one year and not showing up the next year look like, &#8220;Oh no, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with that company. They must not be doing well. They decided not to sponsor. Were they not able to sponsor? Are they pulling back from the community?&#8221; That kind of thing. I wonder what you both think about that, if there are thoughts of what the cost is to not being a sponsor, especially, I guess, if you&#8217;ve been a sponsor before. I guess if you&#8217;ve never been a sponsor, then are you irrelevant already is the first question. And if you were a sponsor and then you aren&#8217;t a sponsor in the future, is there a level of people thinking that you&#8217;re on your way to irrelevance? I don&#8217;t know. I think there&#8217;s a psychological piece to it too, and I wonder what you all think about that, whether there&#8217;s a cost of not being a sponsor or not being there at all. Katie, I know that you weren&#8217;t a sponsor, but you still showed up and were there and were a speaker and had a team there, and they were walking around in their shirts, so clearly not irrelevant, clearly there to support the community. But I wonder if there&#8217;s a cost to not showing up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think it depends on your line of work. I think the main types that can be hurt by not sponsoring are hosting companies because it&#8217;s almost like an arms race to show who&#8217;s the biggest and has the biggest booth. Does the type of booth fit with people&#8217;s perceptions of your scale of company? And it can go both ways, so you kind of do need to choose wisely both whether to just not be sponsoring and, if you are, is it going to make you look good or bad basically. Whereas I think there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a small booth if you are a small company. Like at Barn2, I feel it fits our reputation or whatever. I don&#8217;t think, as far as I know, any eyebrows will be raised by having the small booth. Same with Do the Woo—it&#8217;s a community booth; you&#8217;re not a product company, Bob. So I think it makes sense for you to have that level, but the big companies need to think about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />That&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;ve thought of it, but I&#8217;ve never thought of it in the question that Marcus said because it is perception. And I guess where that perception comes from is probably more for the core community too, is the people that see you all the time and know about you all the time as opposed to maybe new people in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting for sure, and as someone who is largely in charge of running a big booth for a hosting company at flagship events and stuff, it&#8217;s definitely something that we do think about. What is the perception? What is the perception in the giveaways that we&#8217;re giving away? I mean, there&#8217;s definitely the perception aspect to all of it. The design of the booth has to be on par with a large brand or whatever. Sometimes that&#8217;s good, sometimes that&#8217;s bad. Sometimes we want to look more corporate than we are. Sometimes we want to look less corporate than we are—more approachable, less approachable—and there&#8217;s just a lot that goes into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />It&#8217;s interesting. That could actually flow over into the perception of side events too. Why is this person doing this huge side event and this hosting company is having a smaller whatever? Is that another perceived idea that, oh, they&#8217;re kind of cutting back because of whatever? Speaking of side events, I&#8217;m curious, and this kind of gets away a little bit from the sponsorship, but I was talking to Katie a little bit about it: do either of you ever strategically plan side events? Is it just, &#8220;Hey, I am going to sign up for this one, this one; I&#8217;m going to do this,&#8221; and just party or meet people and have fun, or is there some other little method to your madness?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, in my case, I&#8217;m on the clock at camps basically from the time that my plane touches down to when I get back to the airport and head out. And so the side events, for me, are just as much hallway track and networking as any other part of the event, but it is definitely far more casual and easier to jump into conversations. The networking doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean we&#8217;re talking business, but I am getting to know people, creating those relationships and forming friendships with people that I&#8217;ve seen at a few camps and deepening relationships with people that I&#8217;ve seen for the first time or people that I&#8217;ve talked to online a bunch of times and we finally get to meet up in person. So a part of it is trying to figure out where are some of the people that I want to have conversations with going? What are their plans, where are they headed? Some of it is knowing some of the other side event organizers and them asking me specifically, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;d love for you to drop by.&#8221; And then I try to make an attempt to make it to those events. There comes a time where there&#8217;s so many of them that they sort of overlap or even are in the same building, and then you&#8217;re playing that classic TV show where you&#8217;re trying to be in two or three places at once. So you&#8217;re zipping out the back door to drop down to another party for 30 minutes, and then you&#8217;re coming back up, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I just went to the bathroom real quick,&#8221; and trying to keep conversations going and stuff. As far as strategy-wise goes, I&#8217;m there at those to basically just deepen relationships and talk to people and have a good time. And obviously, the benefits of that spill out past the WordCamp event, where I can have conversations back online with folks but know them a little bit better and their personalities and all of that and have better conversations and stuff. As far as time management strategies, that&#8217;s so difficult because you have to map out where each of the events are and what time they&#8217;re happening and when they start and when they end and how far one is from the other. And I don&#8217;t have energy for all of that, but I try to make sure that I&#8217;m getting to the events, especially if someone has specifically asked me, like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to be at this event, and I&#8217;d like to chat with you for some time. Are you going to be there? Would you make it there?&#8221; And then I&#8217;ll try to make it there, and I&#8217;ll have a conversation with those folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, I think with the side events, my strategy has definitely relaxed over the years. When I first started going to WordCamp, I would always make a point of wearing the T-shirt to all the side events. Even costume things like the after parties would often say, &#8220;Wear a costume.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Nope, I want to be in my Barn2 T-shirt, and I want it to say on</p>\n\n\n\n<p>the front and the back what my company is because then people are more likely to come up to me if they know who we are.&#8221; And I think if you are trying to raise awareness and you don&#8217;t know that many people, that is a good strategy. I don&#8217;t particularly do that anymore at the side events because I&#8217;m all networked out by then after the daytime when I was wearing the T-shirt. And I know enough people that there will be people to talk to all evening without needing to advertise my company, and people know me more anyway from the podcast and Twitter and what photos and whatever. So I don&#8217;t do that, but I would recommend it if you&#8217;re just starting out. And also, the parties vary in terms of how loud they are, and really it&#8217;s best to view them as networking events. So the after party… Everybody constantly feeds back that they need a quiet room, but they&#8217;re often very bad at that. They were fine this year at WordCamp US; it was in a museum again like last year’s. But the WordCamp Europe after party was too loud this year, for example, despite feedback saying that they needed quieter areas. So if you just want to talk to people and network, find the quieter parties, which you can do by thinking about the location. Is it a nightclub, or is it in a restaurant or a cocktail bar or something that&#8217;s going to be quieter? So that&#8217;s good. And I heard an interesting tip, which I&#8217;ve never implemented, which is that if you&#8217;ve got multiple team members, send different team members to different side events so that your team has representation across more of the community. I think that&#8217;s kind of a shame because one of the big benefits of WordCamps that we haven&#8217;t talked about is bringing your team together. It may be that you don&#8217;t have company retreats; we don&#8217;t have company retreats. We just bring each team member to their local flagship WordCamp, and that&#8217;s a really good bonding experience for people. And so that&#8217;s another reason to go to WordCamp. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d want to separate them out at a side event, but I can see the business benefit in terms of marketing of doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, at least I thought I&#8217;m like Marcus—if somebody says, &#8220;Are you going to be at this event? I&#8217;d love to talk,&#8221; I truly try to make an effort to be there. And I&#8217;m a little bit more lax on, as long as I&#8217;m not, like I said before, overlapping and not showing up. I sign up for quite a few of them because I also find that often the opportunity comes to meet somebody that I haven&#8217;t met yet at WordCamp—maybe catching up or someone I don&#8217;t know at all—just happened to run into them, say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to this event because I know more people at it or because of the brand or whatever.&#8221; I find myself signing up for just about any event that comes my way that I have time for because what else am I going to be doing—sitting in my room or something? So I might as well be out meeting people. So yeah, I don&#8217;t necessarily have much of a strategy. I do find that I do end up leaving if I can&#8217;t hear what somebody&#8217;s saying. I think one party in Athens—I don&#8217;t know where it was—I damaged my hearing even more than it already is, but it&#8217;s hard to communicate for some of us in those situations, and I will likely make my way to another party if it becomes a point where I just cannot have a conversation at all. But yeah, I think it&#8217;s going to all depend on what works for you and what is right for you and some of that stuff. I&#8217;ve had people actually say to me that they went to a side event and they found out it was almost too overwhelming, even more so than the WordCamps. There was just too much socializing, and they were ready for some downtime and stuff. So you&#8217;ve just got to kind of play it by ear and decide what works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. My last side event question was going to be, we sort of all agree that there are good networking opportunities. Do you tend to talk shop at those or not? Or does it depend? Are you looking to just hang out and get to know people who they are a little bit better? Are you offended if people come up to you and ask to talk shop? How do you handle those conversations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I go with the flow. I&#8217;m happy to do either and to allow people to lead. Sometimes I&#8217;ll be meeting new people, and you may end up talking shop because you&#8217;ve done perhaps some collaboration with them in the past online and you&#8217;ve not met in person, or you might use it as a chance to get to know each other personally, which helps to strengthen your professional relationship. Or at other side events, I end up speaking with people I already know well and already know everything about their businesses. So we would be talking about other things then. So I think, unless you have a really clear strategy, which is fine, you can go with the flow and see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Whatever way the wind blows, however it works. Although it was very ironic that the first three flagships I went to after we moved to Portugal, 90% of the people who walked up to me, the first question out of their mouth was, &#8220;How is Portugal?&#8221; So I repeated that story numerous times for three different flagship WordCamps—at least probably, yeah, maybe hundreds of times and stuff. So I didn&#8217;t talk shop a lot because people didn&#8217;t care about that. All they wanted to know was how the move and how Portugal went.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That&#8217;s what happens if you&#8217;re famous and have an interesting story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. I know we could go on and on. Is there a little tip or strategy that you&#8217;ve found works, that doesn&#8217;t kind of fall into the norm, or something that just helps people who are going and trying to navigate whether it&#8217;s their first time or they&#8217;re within their first few WordCamps that they&#8217;re still trying to find out the right thing to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, so I&#8217;ll take it from the introvert&#8217;s perspective because, as weird as it is for me to have a job where I go to WordCamps and talk to people, I am more introverted by nature. So what I do—what I find is extremely helpful—is I&#8217;ll get wherever the camp is, at least kind of the day before everything starts happening, and give myself a few hours to just leave on my own and go explore the city, go explore just outside the city. If there&#8217;s a WordCamp US in Portland this year, there are great places to go hiking and see some stuff outdoors as well. Just get away from everyone else for a couple of hours because the entire event is going to be very &#8220;peopley.&#8221; You&#8217;re going to be non-stop talking to people from the time that registration starts to the time that the side event after party or whatever ends. And so you&#8217;re talking at least a day, but in many cases, multiple days worth of just being around, being surrounded by people and talking to people constantly. And so I generally try to just get away for a couple of hours by myself. I&#8217;ll grab either my camera or just have my phone on me and just go out away and take pictures and walk around and just enjoy the silence, I guess, for a little bit. And then that really prepares me to be in a headspace to talk to people for many hours at a time. And so I highly recommend doing that for anyone who&#8217;s mildly introverted, I guess, just to give yourself some time to be on your own before you get into being around everyone else for that long of a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Well, that definitely applies to the majority of people who attend WordCamps as well, probably unlike conferences in some other industries. But that is definitely the case with WordCamp attendees as a whole. So my advice would be to do with networking. If you don&#8217;t already know people at a WordCamp, you need to understand it&#8217;s the sort of place you can just go up to somebody and talk to them. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you say—just, &#8220;Oh, hey, I&#8217;m so-and-so, what do you do?&#8221; People are open to that. And I&#8217;d say this even as a woman in a male-dominated industry. People don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s strange if you just go up to people and talk to them. They also don&#8217;t act inappropriately. It&#8217;s just everybody is friendly, accepts that it&#8217;s a networking event, and you can do that. So even if you are quite shy and you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp before, do that because I think you could listen to Marcus and say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know anyone. I&#8217;m not going to spend all day talking.&#8221; Actually, you should just go into the sponsor hall and go up to the sponsors. You may get into conversations with people near the sponsor booths as well. That&#8217;s a good place for networking if you don&#8217;t already know people. So do end up talking to people and try and remember them. I&#8217;m really bad at this. You talk to so many people, and then you&#8217;re probably going to have some kind of contact through collaborations or link exchanges or whatever kind of partnership work you do with other people—or hiring them or being hired by them or any of these things. At some point in the future, they may well remember you and you don&#8217;t remember them. And that happens to me all the time. And so try and write down who you&#8217;ve talked to or something and keep that because you never know when you need a bit of help with the memory. Overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah, good to take a picture of a selfie or take a picture of them. Then you can zoom in on their name tag if it&#8217;s not flipped over, and you can see their name at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Good advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;ve done that a few times. And a little bit of piggyback on the networking. What I always tell people is visit all the vendors, all the sponsors, and it&#8217;s kind of two-part. One is, they&#8217;re not going to be, like Marcus said, none of them are like these huge high-pressure sales pitches you may have experienced at other conferences that you&#8217;ve gone to. They do like to talk, and you never know what will happen in a conversation. That&#8217;s just what Katie was saying—going up and talking to people. You never know what kind of connection you&#8217;re going to make, what may happen down the road, what kind of friendship you might build. So make sure and do that. And another thing I learned early on to do is as you&#8217;re looking at the sponsor list, if there&#8217;s a sponsor that you&#8217;re not familiar with, there is a new name, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Especially some of the smaller sponsors will be that way,&#8221; and you think, &#8220;Oh, is this somebody I should know about?&#8221; Go and check out their website. And if it&#8217;s somebody that you think would be worth getting to know better, or maybe it&#8217;s a product or a service that you&#8217;re thinking you&#8217;d really find valuable, learn a little bit about their business—just enough to be able to walk up to them and not say, &#8220;Hey, what do you do?&#8221; Say, &#8220;Hey, I checked out your site, and I noticed you do these couple of things, and I&#8217;m kind of interested in that one part of it.&#8221; And probably a lot of sponsors will go, &#8220;Wow, this person actually took the time,&#8221; and the conversation&#8217;s going to go a lot more smoothly. And you don&#8217;t want to do that with every sponsor—do the research—but there might be some that maybe you want to become an affiliate, maybe you want to… Something you have in your mind, you might segue into a conversation knowing a little bit about them better than just asking, &#8220;What do you do?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s good advice. And linked to that, we haven&#8217;t mentioned the attendee list that you can read through—a list of the people who are going beforehand. It&#8217;s a long list. There are thousands of people on it, but if you are just starting out and you don&#8217;t know who you want to meet with, it&#8217;s a really good idea, I think, to spend half an hour reading through it and just seeing what names jump out at you. It might be individuals&#8217; names that, I don&#8217;t know, you follow on Twitter or have had some kind of contact with or seen in a podcast or doing a talk at a previous WordCamp. Anything to make you recognize them and think maybe you want to reach out beforehand and arrange to connect with them. Or alternatively, you might recognize their company name and think, actually, yeah, I could get some business benefit from having an in-person connection with someone from that company. So the attendee list is another way to do that as well as the sponsors. So that&#8217;s been great. I think we&#8217;ve covered a lot of different angles of how to get the most out of a WordCamp, whether you are sponsoring, speaking, or just attending. So I hope everybody has a great time at WordCamp US, and we&#8217;ll all be there. And yeah, I hope it&#8217;s useful.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this <strong>Woo BizChat, Marcus Burnette, Katie Keith, and BobWP</strong> dive into how to get the most out of <strong><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCampUS</a></strong>, whether you’re sponsoring, speaking, or just attending. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They talk about balancing sessions with networking, especially through side events, and the long-term perks of building connections in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, they share some useful tips for introverts and newcomers on how to navigate WordCamps and make the experience as rewarding as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing WordCamp Activities</strong>: Attendees should consider balancing session attendance with networking opportunities, such as hallway tracks and side events. Sessions can often be viewed later online, so focusing on networking might provide more immediate value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Networking Strategy</strong>: It&#8217;s important to be open to meeting new people and networking, even for introverts. Approaching sponsors and other attendees can lead to valuable connections and collaborations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speaking at WordCamps</strong>: Speaking at WordCamps can be a great way to build personal and company branding, even if it doesn&#8217;t directly lead to immediate business. It&#8217;s also a good opportunity to support the community and share expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sponsorship Considerations</strong>: Sponsorships are more about brand awareness and community involvement than immediate sales ROI. However, sponsors should be mindful of the perception their presence (or absence) may create within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Side Events</strong>: Side events are valuable for casual networking and building relationships. Attendees might consider which events to attend based on who they want to connect with and the atmosphere of the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Preparation Tips</strong>: For newcomers or those who are introverted, it&#8217;s helpful to take some time alone before the event, research sponsors and attendees, and approach networking in a relaxed, go-with-the-flow manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team Strategy</strong>: If attending with a team, consider spreading out across different side events to maximize the company’s presence and networking opportunities, though it’s also important to use the event as a team-building experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"Do The Woo Community: Welcome Our New Sponsor Kinsta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=85506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/welcome-our-new-sponsor-kinsta/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2429:\"<p>Hey everyone!

The porn ban didn’t help matters, but the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/15/is-the-exodus-over-heres-how-twitter-alternatives-have-fared-since-elon-musks-acquisition/\">Twitter Exodus</a> of early 2023 following Elon Musk’s acquisition of the social media site gave it a sudden boost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The migration announcement post said, “We’re not talking about changing Tumblr. We’re not turning Tumblr into WordPress. That would defeat the purpose. We acquired Tumblr to benefit from its differences and strengths, not to water it down. We love Tumblr’s streamlined posting experience and its current product direction. We’re not changing that. We’re talking about running Tumblr’s backend on WordPress. You won’t even notice a difference from the outside.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic <a href=\"https://x.com/automattic/status/1829097044549489008\">reiterated</a> that<strong> “The changes will be exclusively at the backend.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The migration though not easy &#8211; with Tumblr hosting over half a billion blogs &#8211; will be a win-win situation for both WordPress and Tumblr. Automattic believes that “Tumblr will benefit from the collective effort that goes into the open source WordPress project. And WordPress will benefit from the tools and creativity we invest into Tumblr and contribute back to WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Men Wanted for Hazardous Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic is actively seeking experienced PHP programmers to undertake this migration project. Matt compared this to the famous British explorer Ernest Shackleton’s recruitment ad for his Antarctic expedition, which read, “Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/tumblr-migration/\">advertisement continues</a>, “If you’re an experienced programmer… if you’re a SQL‑slinger… if you’ve worked on other big audacious projects like this… if Gordian knots tremble in your presence, we want to work with you!”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;We’re already seeing interesting candidates apply and resume review is underway for full-time roles. All relevant experience is welcome, particularly those who have worked on other large migrations or are just excited about working on a challenge of this size.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Bob Ralian, Tumblr Migration Lead</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested candidates can apply through the <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/tumblr-migration/\">website</a> giving a brief introduction about themselves. The post does not give any details about the remuneration or the application deadline. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Response&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt <a href=\"https://x.com/photomatt/status/1829675793058054285\">tweeted</a> “I&#8217;m excited about this one.”, while <a href=\"https://x.com/karks88/status/1829677054625038789\">Eric Karkovack</a> of Speckyboy quipped “Will there be a project status blog? If so, I&#8217;d recommend calling it &#8220;Tumblng Into WordPress&#8221;.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Platform Lead Engineer at Pew Research Center <a href=\"https://x.com/SethRubenstein/status/1828977899082252368\">Seth Rubenstein</a> tweeted, “This is so exciting. I hope this means it becomes easier to create Tumblr themes in the future; especially, dare I say, if they’re just block themes…” <a href=\"https://x.com/courtneyr_dev/status/1828979569581298069\">Courtney Robertson</a>, Open Source Developer Advocate at GoDaddy, also hopes to see more “ block themes supporting post formats SOON.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head of WP Relations at Elementor, <a href=\"https://x.com/miriamschwab/status/1829058002520789443\">Miriam Schwab</a> dubbed it “The ultimate &#8220;data liberation&#8221; project” while Developer Advocate WPEngine <a href=\"https://x.com/dcook/status/1829204853790519320\">Damon Cook </a>speculated, “I wonder if there will be outcomes from this large migration that could overlap and help solve pieces of the Data Liberation project.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product Designer <a href=\"https://x.com/ybhrdwj/status/1829030113402355723\">Yash Bhardwaj </a>was excited ”This will go down in history books similar to some ancient empire conquering another.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/nickweisser/status/1829461378588950606\">Nick Weisser</a> of Openstream is optimistic “This would represent a significant increase in the market share of #WordPress, pushing it from around 43% to over 60%?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure no one foresaw these developments when Jeff Chandler wrote “<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-be-more-tumblr-like\">WordPress To Be More Tumblr Like</a>” in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:18:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WPTavern: State of CSS 2024 Survey Now Open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=160779\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-css-2024-survey-now-open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2802:\"<p>The annual <a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/the-2024-state-of-css-survey-is-now-open-4o5h\">State of CSS 2024</a> Survey is officially open. The survey aims to explore the “world of styles and selectors to try and identify upcoming trends, and figure out what features and tools to learn next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organized by Devographics, with support from contributors, translators, and volunteers, the survey is open to everyone. CSS users are encouraged to <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2024\">take the survey </a>by September 7, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s survey introduces several new features and takes around 15-20 minutes to complete, with all questions being optional. The survey covers 11 key topics, including Layout, Shapes and Graphics, Colors, Interactions, Accessibility, and a concluding ‘About You’ section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch in 2019, the survey has grown in popularity, with 9,190 developers participating last year. Some insights from the previous survey include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Most participants were from the USA, followed by Germany and the UK.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61.3% of respondents identified as male, 7.7% as female, and 1.4% as non-binary or gender non-conforming.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS topped the list in terms of usage, while Tailwind CSS and PureCSS led in retention.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CSS was primarily used for web apps, blogs, and marketing sites.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Subgrid was the most commented feature, Open Props the technology with the highest percentage of returning users and Panda the tool most mentioned in freeform questions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey data is valuable for browser vendors, influencing their focus areas and roadmaps. Rachel Andrew, content lead for web.dev and developer.chrome.com at Google, <a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/state-of-css-2024\">shared </a>that the State of CSS survey is one of the methods they use to learn what&#8217;s important to the developers. “These surveys let you tell us exactly what you are using, and what you want to use but can&#8217;t due to bugs or lack of support. They help us to see the places where more learning materials might be helpful, or which things we should prioritize for implementation in the browser.”, she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sacha Greif mentioned that this year, the team aims to release the results within weeks after the survey closes. The next surveys on the schedule are the <a href=\"https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues/235\">State of HTML 2024</a> (September 10), the <a href=\"https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues/243\">State of React 2024</a> (October 10), and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues/227\">State of JavaScript 2024</a> (November 10).</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 14:38:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 85: WordPress in Education\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=17643\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/episode-85-wordpress-in-education/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14022:\"<p>Discover why WordPress is becoming a cornerstone in student education.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It&#8217;s been a while since I talked to you about the digital divide. In case you&#8217;re a brand new listener, check out episode 17, and actually everyone, just go check out episode 17 because bridging the digital divide, teaching people how to embrace technology fully and how to make it work for you, is one of the primary motivators of my decisions in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> WordPress&#8217;s unique position as both a tool that&#8217;s ubiquitous in its use and a community that is all-encompassing in its skill set means that if you know a bit about how open source works, you can use it as a tool to learn digital literacy and practice technical skills. Even though this is one of my primary motivators, I have never actually succeeded at getting WordPress into schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying, it&#8217;s not for lack of interest from the community; it&#8217;s more that it&#8217;s hard to fit into curriculum-based learning. After all, we&#8217;ve had ways to learn WordPress for as long as we&#8217;ve had ways to use WordPress. It&#8217;s just that it takes a long time to design instructional material, even when you know the content like the back of your hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And open source stuff just moves really quickly. However, that didn&#8217;t stop us from spending years refining the content that we do have into the learning pathways you can now find on learn.WordPress.org. If you&#8217;re an educator, you can use those almost out of the box. But if you&#8217;ve got learners in your home and want to make a case for why their school should bring a little WordPress based digital literacy into the classroom, I&#8217;ve got five good arguments for you for why they should give us a chance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first one, as I mentioned before, WordPress as a tool is practically ubiquitous. It powers a significant portion of the web, so it&#8217;s easy to find examples to aspire to and content creators for guidance. And given that it is so prevalent, knowing WordPress ensures that students are well prepared for a wide range of job opportunities in the digital industry, making them more competitive in the job market overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is that WordPress is a free and open source piece of software. In our case, it&#8217;s free in both meanings of the word. Free, as in no cost and no constraints. That means students have freedom to experiment with the code and with the design, which gives you that feeling of joyous experimentation that a lot of us had at the start of the web before there were CMSs. It taps into a different kind of creativity that results in technical curiosity and, ultimately, growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that the best way to learn WordPress happens to also align with the concept of project-based learning, which is one of the best methods for learning in general. I believe that to be true. I&#8217;m not an educator, but I really believe that project-based learning is the best way to learn complex topics. It&#8217;s an active way to learn. You get a bunch of tactical skills in there, like development, alongside the basics of good collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Obviously, these are all skills that are directly valuable in the workplace, but I have also found them profoundly useful in my day-to-day existence. You know, as a human participating in a society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number four is a bit of a spicy nugget, but WordPress is essential for creating and managing digital content, which is table stakes right now. That&#8217;s a foundational skill for most web dev jobs, but also marketing, journalism, and communications. And beyond that, everyone knows that your best leaders are the people who can tell a compelling story based on the information they have. The ones who can connect the dots in a way that makes it matter to you. This is a spicy, of course, because of the confusing do si do that AI is taking with the content landscape. But I believe that people are the best storytellers, and stories are what keep us all moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing is that there is a whole wide world of open source. There are so many products and projects that use an open source license, right? Like you, listener, I can guarantee I don&#8217;t even know who you are, but I can guarantee that you use at least one item a day that has some open source thing in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most of these open source projects are international. They&#8217;re developed on a global scale across numerous countries by people with various levels of education. And it&#8217;s this vastness of scope, this broadness of connection, that will give you, give your student, a chance to understand how to work across cultures, how to build something that is more than the sum of its parts, and how to embrace the concept of altruistic generosity that leads to a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Because just as I&#8217;m sure that you, a complete stranger, touched something open source today, I&#8217;m equally sure that the people we bring into open source will be able to solve the biggest problems of tomorrow with better connections and more skill because of what we taught them here today.&nbsp;If all of this sounds compelling, but you&#8217;re not ready to, like, go into your school administrator, your superintendent, your local, I don&#8217;t know, education board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this felt right, but you don&#8217;t know for sure, and you want a little bit more experience with it before you go advocate for it yourself, I will have in the show notes over on WordPress.org, I&#8217;ll have in the show notes of this podcast a series of events that are coming up. We have a couple that have already gone by WPCampus, I think just wrapped up a few weeks ago. But there are a handful of events that are happening across the world that is specific to youth wanting to learn technology, working with WordPress to get that done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then educators as well. You can also always stop by the Training Team and ask them questions about how this all works, why it works together their philosophies behind their learning pathways. There are so many ways that you can get answers to the questions that you might have about why open source, and especially WordPress, is worth trying to get your students exposed to and working in and contributing to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings me, now that I have finished with my little soapbox, to our small list of big things. Gosh, I hope you all missed hearing teeny tiny rants about WordPress and open source from me over the break that I took in August, but before you respond to that, feel free to respond to me in any comments. Let&#8217;s first get to the small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, the full WordCamp US schedule has been released, so if you&#8217;re planning to attend that, you can take a look and get your schedule, your personal schedule, for the week figured out. But if you&#8217;re still on the fence, there might be a speaker or two in there that tips the scales for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship Program Cohort number three, the third one, will happen in Q4 this year. The call for mentors and mentees has just been completed. But you should keep an eye out on September 9th, I think. So, at the end of this week, the final list will be announced. This program has been excellent for mentors to give back to the community while enhancing their leadership skills. And the mentees who participate have received personalized guidance and a chance to develop skills and network within the community, and a good portion of them continue to contribute to WordPress itself and other open source projects that we rely on as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that YouTube has been an essential platform for sharing complex ideas with a diverse audience. And our WordPress YouTube channel is no exception. It has been slowly warming itself up. We have a team that&#8217;s warming up the content over there. WordCamp information gets on it now. But in keeping with our commitment to meeting the needs of both current and future users, just making sure that we meet people where they are, I&#8217;m excited to announce that Jamie Marsland will be taking on the management of the WordPress YouTube channel. So for anyone who&#8217;s attending WordCamp US, stop by and say hello to Jamie in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, finally, I have a really important call to action. So, we are still working to reactivate our meetup groups. The Community Team is driving that charge, and they need your help to reactivate any group that&#8217;s inactive. Last month, a list of groups was shared and marked for removal from our chapter program. And we requested responses by August 5th to keep those groups active, but due to the summer holiday, we have extended it a little bit. We&#8217;ve extended it to September 16th, which, if I am remembering my calendar correctly, is a couple weeks from now. So if your group is on that pending closure list, email support@wordcamp.org to let us know if you want to reactivate the group or if you are ready to step down and have a new leader show up, and we can help you figure out how to get that done. Either way, if you&#8217;re on the list, email us let us know what your hopes and, dreams, and plans are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:58]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

Is that news?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, in an episode a bit ago, <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/unpacking-blogging-a-blogstorm-with-ronald-gijsel-and-bobwp/\">Ronald and I chatted about this</a> during our Blogstorm</strong> and shared what it means to us and what we plan on doing with this blog. The fact the site was sans blog for sometime, well, that&#8217;s another story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially you will see that there are already <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/\">some posts here</a></strong> that were, well, moved over to BobWP.com and now have returned here, their original home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why a soft relaunch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two reasons. First, still getting a lot of things in place on the backend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are now into September and people are winding down from summer. Plus we want to make it more official during <strong><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCampUS 2024</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a lot of plans for this blog and to model it after our podcast, a blog for the community, by the community. And as we move along, and share more, you will have a better understanding why we think this is kind of a &#8220;big deal&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, keep your eyes and ears open as we tell it all during WordCampUS.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 10:15:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"Do The Woo Community: Scaling WooCommerce: Insights on High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) with Vedanshu Jain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=85448\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://dothewoo.io/scaling-woocommerce-insights-on-high-performance-order-storage-hpos-with-vedanshu-jain/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58379:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-18 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-17 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-5 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-16 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-9 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-15 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1650\" height=\"1650\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/avalara-logo-_dtw.png?resize=1650%2C1650&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-75400\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-10\"><strong><a href=\"https://developer.avalara.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Avalara</a></strong>: help developers make sure their Woo projects are tax compliance done right with Avalara&#8217;s API.

Welcome to another episode of Woo Have Chat. Today with me, the one and only Mike. Hello, Mike. I was trying to think of a fancy way to introduce you today, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />That&#8217;s what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />That’s as fancy as I can get. Yes. How are you doing, man? All good?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I&#8217;m good, I&#8217;m good. Monday morning. Got to do some work today using New Relic to troubleshoot WooCommerce. So maybe there’ll be some stuff to talk about with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Oh wow. Alright, today’s a very special episode. We are excited to introduce Vedanshu Jain. He&#8217;s a senior software engineer and a key contributor to the WooCommerce project at Automattic. I guess for the last six years, but he&#8217;ll correct me if I did the math correctly. Lately, he has been concentrating on scaling and performance. He plays a pivotal role in leading the HPOS project. Also, we did talk about the pronunciation of HPOS, if that’s the correct way to pronounce it or not. We’re going to be corrected in a minute. He’s also worked on numerous performance enhancements and has helped many merchants fine-tune their sites to handle greater scale. So let&#8217;s dive into his insights. Welcome to the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Hello, hello. Very happy to be here. So yeah, I have been working for six years now at Automattic, which is more than half a decade. So yeah, that’s a lot. HPOS, I guess I pronounce it HPOS, but I do not think we have an official pronunciation. So I suppose as long as we can communicate, it’s fine, but it can get a little bit hard to figure out what you’re talking about. H-P-O-S, it’s all the same. No problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right? Well, there are many ways to pronounce it, and most of the people we talk to about HPOS or HPOS, they go and say, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; Regardless of the way that you pronounce it. So I guess you’re right, we need to explain to people what that is. Would you mind explaining very quickly? I know we did an episode about this previously, but there might be some people who don’t know what we’re talking about and have the exact same response to HPOS: What the hell is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Yeah, so HPOS is basically High Performance Order Storage. What we did with that project is that WooCommerce by default used to store order data in posts and post meta tables using custom post types, which is a feature in WordPress. It’s a great feature, and we have been quite successful users of that feature, like WooCommerce and many other plugins in general. But orders specifically can grow really fast. For a successful site, you can have hundreds, thousands, and millions of orders, and then storing them all in posts and post meta tables means that different operations on the site are going to compete with all this bulk of orders for all their normal operations, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it’s the same table, it’s the same data storage. So what HPOS does is it stores just the order data in different tables so that your posts and post meta tables are free to serve your post content, to serve the site’s content, products, attributes, and all those other things. So in a sense, it makes your site faster, but maybe that’s not a super accurate way to say it. I think a more accurate way to say it is that it’ll make your site more scalable. So when you’re receiving this bulk of orders, your site will not be slowed down just because there are millions of entries in the post meta table due to orders or just because of the orders that you’re receiving. So it sets your site up for easier scaling for your growth, and yeah, that’s what the whole project is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Great. Do you think this is for all merchants out there using WooCommerce? Is this for just people who have a hundred thousand orders? Is this for people who are just starting out and need to activate this no matter what? What is your recommendation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So if you are starting out, I 100% recommend that you start with HPOS because you are going to hit growth—or at least you want to hit growth—or at least we hope that you’re going to hit that growth, and then you will need it. So it doesn’t make sense when you’re starting out to not start with HPOS because everything else is the same; everything else is equivalent. You will have very similar interfaces; you have all the major plugins already providing support with HPOS, so you have the same experience. So for the shops that are starting out, I highly recommend starting with HPOS, which is also the default. If you set up a new site with WooCommerce now, you will start on HPOS. Additionally, for shops that are hitting growth or shops that are already using custom post types because they have been in business for some time now, I do recommend that you consider switching to HPOS whenever you can because if you don’t—or let’s say you don’t have time now—then when you hit growth, you would want to do it, and then you would do it in a bit of a stressful situation because orders are coming in, the site is slowing down, and now you want to start planning it. It would be a bit more stressful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you can plan it early, that’s really great because that’s what we are trying to get everyone towards, which is just an HPOS-based future. We do want people to scale well. We do want people to have great experiences with WooCommerce at any stage of growth. So yeah, I recommend HPOS if you start out, but also if you already have a shop that’s on custom post types, plan your migration when you can plan it without stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right. Most people don’t have HPOS activated by default, I guess I would say. And most people are also afraid to activate it if they already have a store and it’s a big store. I didn’t want to talk too much about this, but I think it’s a good way just again to remind people about how great of a feature this is. Would you still recommend people to invest a small amount of time in activating it? And would you say it is hard or very easy to activate HPOS?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />We do understand the complexity involved in it. So you’re basically on a live site, you’re basically replacing one of the key components of that site. You’re basically replacing where very critical data is being stored live. Understandably, it’s a bit daunting and intimidating. The good thing is we have in-built rollback mechanisms, which means that you can switch to HPOS, you can try it out, you can verify if it works fine. In a situation where it does not work fine, the rollback is possible. So from the interface itself, you can switch back to post tables, and then everything would be as it was before. So we do have some safeguards. We do have some fail-safe mechanisms, which basically mean that even if you found some issue or even if you find that you do not have the time anymore or even if you—or for whatever reason—want to switch back, you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing is that you do try to make some time here and give it a shot. So we also have a guide on the WooCommerce blog which tells you some steps that, if you’re running a high-volume site, what you can do or the series of steps that you can perform, some basic testing, some testing on staging, and then how you disable. So when you switch to HPOS for the first time from a shop that is using post storage, we would be writing data to both post and HPOS tables. So there is a series of steps that you can disable this sync methodologically. So this way, basically, you would have some ramp from post to HPOS, and if something goes wrong, you can go back to post again, and that guide will detail all that—what you can do, what you should do, what you should test for, and what you should expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Actually, the reason why we got to Vedanshu in the first place was a very interesting one because Mike had this client who had this very particular use case, and he was asking me, &#8220;Do you know somebody?&#8221; And I did know somebody else that works at Automattic and managed a lot of the WooCommerce-related projects. It was very interesting to ask Darren about, &#8220;Hey, we have this particular issue. Mike has this client. We would like to talk to somebody who can give us an answer, or at least a very comforting answer, about the way that we can solve this particular problem.&#8221; Mike, do you want to share a little bit about this story?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, we mentioned it briefly in the first podcast, and it’s a Shark Tank client who gets a lot of orders. They had moved to HPOS but still had the backward compatibility thing enabled. I was doing… They wanted a backend troubleshooting project done, and they were having weird delays, and I noticed this consistent query that was showing up that was taking 40 seconds. I remember asking you on the way to go play squash, Marcel, and you were like, &#8220;Oh yeah, those are the HPOS tables. They shouldn’t be taking that long.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, the whole benefit of introducing HPOS was that search queries and things like that were supposed to get way faster.&#8221; I think you had a client as well who had a similar challenge, and we were trying to gather data. I tried rewriting the queries to make them more precise</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so they weren’t using likes or wildcards and that kind of stuff, and it still didn’t really make that much of a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then we went on this adventure to figure out who can help us answer this. This is not what was supposed to happen. Then we met Vedanshu at the WooCommerce party in Turin, and you said, &#8220;Oh, there’s this new feature with these indexes that we are adding in WooCommerce 9.00 beta 2, which should speed that up significantly.&#8221; I think a week or two later, I managed to get it tested, and the same queries ended up taking a hundred milliseconds, and I was like, &#8220;Ha, it works!&#8221; And Vedanshu was so confident at the party—I don’t know if you remember—he was like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, just install this. It should be way better.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I do remember, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Marcel and I were both a little bit skeptical, we’re not going to lie, because we were like, &#8220;How is it going to go from 40 seconds to anything acceptable? There’s a long way down to two or three seconds.&#8221; So yeah, we were very pleasantly surprised to see that it made things significantly faster. We were curious about how you go into researching, developing, proposing, and sort of testing. That’s a major change because building a separate index for all of the order emails and stuff like that so it’s basically instant—that doesn’t sound like it’s something you just snap your fingers and it magically gets done. So I’m curious what that process is like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So I think for the context, you’re talking about the HPOS text search, which is basically full-text search in MySQL. This is something that we wanted to do for a long time, even before HPOS, but the structure, but our way of storing data where we would store data in the post meta tables, was a blocker for us to do it because you cannot add this index on the entirety of the post meta table because it would make your space requirements for the database or RAM requirements go way up. So I guess for research, even before HPOS, one of the things that we researched is what would be possible because just changing the database structure without leveraging the features of that structure is not going to just speed up the site. But what you would get with this sort of architecture change is basically collateral gains, which means that even just by changing that data structure, nothing happens by default. You would need to write those queries, you would need to build those in, and you would need to do some work on top of it to actually take advantage of this new structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, we decided to have this addressable separately so that we can apply an FTS index on it. So yeah, I guess it depends on doing some planning ahead on what you want to do with this feature once it’s out, once it’s built. This is something that a normalized structure would allow you to do, is that you can add more indexes, you can add very specific indexes on the data structure or on the query requirements that you have. FTS is one example, but there are some more. For example, for many shops, they might be querying some specific column more often than the other ones. Even if WooCommerce does not provide a default index on that column specifically, the merchant can add it, or the developers can add it. So for research, we take a look at what we can do right now, what are the things that are blocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even with post meta, you can scale a site quite well. You have been in business for quite a while, and you would know that even with posts and post meta, you would have experienced that you can scale a site quite well. It’s just that there are some things where this structure would start becoming a blocker. There are some features that you cannot explore anymore. You can still work around it. For example, you could stream the order data to Elasticsearch and provide the search from there. You could do many workarounds, but it’s not straightforward, it’s not simple enough, it’s not something that works out of the box. So this is that we actually did figure out what we wanted. Even if you see the issue—like the issue for the FTS index—it opened two years back when HPOS was still in planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We opened the issue then that this is something that we would do once HPOS has rolled out. There are some more enhancements that we still have in mind, and hopefully, we would be able to roll those out soon enough. But yeah, we try to look at what is currently possible, what is currently not possible with the existing structure, what are the blockers, and try to figure out how we go from there. But FTS and index is something that’s been on our mind for a bit now. I think for the WordPress core project too, they also have an issue open to add FTS indexes for post content and the main post table so that you are able to search post content way more faster than you can right now. But yeah…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />How would you test something like that? So let’s say, for example, you get your team together and you decide, &#8220;Oh, let’s do these indexes, this full-text index thing, and we have now a new table, and we’re going to turn this on,&#8221; and now you go, &#8220;Yeah, but first to make a decision, I would imagine that you have to base it on results, and you have to have some data that will back up the decision about activating or proposing for everybody to activate this.&#8221; I know how well most people probably have their MySQL database settings set up in a way that it’s possible to use it, but how would you go about measuring the success of something like this and say with confidence now for everybody that this is going to benefit everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So for testing, the primary testbed is some of the test sites that we have, that we host on. So basically they’re hosted on WordPress.com. Some of those sites have about 1 million orders or 600,000 orders, and we primarily test against… So that’s the first step in feature development. We would build these queries, we would manually create these indexes using direct MySQL queries, try to run queries, compare the differences, and see if it’s something that’s worthwhile to pursue. If it is, then we would try to build it into a feature, and then we would do this testing that we are doing right now. So currently, FTS indexes are marked as experimental. One of the things that currently actually blocks it from graduating, or sort of graduating away from experimental to enable by default, is that in some specific versions, we find that the results are inconsistent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do not recall exactly, but anyway, I think from MySQL version 8.2.0.24 to 8.2.0.31, you will see that the site will be unable to create this index because of a MySQL bug, which was then fixed in 8.2.0.35. Okay, so this is something we learned. Once we have this package, once we have this in experimental, we do not know how it’ll go. We got these reports that this person is not able to create this index on the site, we go and try to debug, and then we find out that okay, this is some MySQL bug, and you have to upgrade a MySQL version to actually have this working. So once you put a feature in experimental, we try to make some noise about it or try to have more people use it. Some people would have great experiences like you have, and then some people will find out some edge cases and report them back to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we would eventually graduate the feature when we are confident that we have resolved most of the edge cases. We know that this feature will not break sites just on upgrading. We know that this feature will not break sites just on enabling it. So this is the same process we followed for HPOS. We had an experimental mode for quite a long time. We made a lot of noise about it. We requested people to try it out. Some people had great experiences, some people reported bugs, and we tried to fix them as much as we can. Eventually, you’ll see that once you release something as experimental, you get a lot of bug reports soon. Depending on how big the feature is, you will get bug reports very soon, and then they will start to drop off. Once they sort of stabilize, once you have fixed all the high-priority bugs, you can mark that feature as stable. This is something that we did for HPOS; this is something that we are doing for FTS indexes. But actually, FTS indexes are quite stable. There are some edge cases—there is another edge case around phone numbers, which it is not able to search properly, which is something that I actually have on my list to look into today. But other than that, it seems quite stable. Hopefully, we will be able to graduate it soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I guess also indexes are a feature of the database engine. It’s not something or some code that you guys wrote and are experimenting with like it is with HPOS, right? You sort of trust the engineers who created the database engine on it working as it should be, as it was created for. I imagine it would be kind of easier to make the decision in terms of activating that as opposed to HPOS, which is—or HPOS, I’m going to call it HPOS for the rest of the podcast—just shorter. It’s shorter. It’s the way that we’ve been talking about it the whole time, so it’s very hard for me to change it. Where you have this synchronization</p>\n\n\n\n<p>going on, you have important data copying. I imagine that is a much harder update to do than just the index, right? Let’s imagine the following: You were sitting down in front of a computer, you were talking to some friends, and somebody came up and said, &#8220;Hey, I have this great idea to build something for WordPress that is an e-commerce platform, and let’s call it, for example, WooCommerce.&#8221; What would you architect differently in terms of the database in comparison to today? So if you were to be able to, at day zero, decide on the architecture of the database, what would you do differently?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Okay, so that’s a very interesting question. I also wanted to talk a little bit about what you said earlier about the FTS indexes. So FTS index is one of MySQL’s features. You can do a CREATE INDEX statement and have it enabled, but it’s a little bit more complex because it has a lot of tuning parameters. For example, you can specify… Right now we have configured it to work on natural language, so it would split words based on spaces, apostrophes, and all the natural language separators. But you can also create just trigrams or n-grams. You can configure it to behave more similar to Elasticsearch. So there are some configuration parameters that you can play around with depending on the use case of your site. So this experimental time is also meant for us to figure out what the optimized state of tuning for that feature is, which we may end up changing based on the feedback that we get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But otherwise, it’s much more stable than HPOS because we trust the developers of MySQL very much. It’s an extremely great piece of software. Right, okay. So if you think about the journey of WooCommerce, the CPT integration with custom post types gave it, in my opinion, a much-needed lift when it needed it. Developers understand custom post types; developers understand playing around with it, extending it, modifying its API. So integrating it with custom post types rather than building a new table from the start I think was a good decision—or at least in my opinion—because it allows you to, first of all, build it really quickly because then you do not have to create all these custom queries. You do not have to manage the caching around it. You do not have to do a lot of things. WordPress will do the heavy lifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, you don’t even need to create an admin interface. You don’t even need to worry about access controls, security, performance, and so many things that are just taken care of for you, including the programmatic API to access it. So it’s extremely powerful, and I think at that point, using custom post types even for orders was the right choice. For a new project, for everything new, if I were sitting in a friend circle—maybe we were at a campfire roasting some marshmallows—if someone tells me that we are doing this new thing, I would use as much existing functionality as I can, or at least… So depending on who you ask, depending on what developer you ask, this is probably going to change. I think for any product, there is no singular success path. For every product, it’s going to be different, and you can make a product work using all parts, or a product will not work even if you have the best architecture—it’s implementation details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don’t know, in my opinion, I would use WordPress features as much as I can and build custom functionality when I have to. But when you see this scale, unless WordPress starts coming in the way, I don’t think that I would engineer a feature to work around it or to bypass it. The other case is if the philosophy of what WordPress provides is completely different from what the feature intends to do, which it kind of is in the case of orders because they’re never going to be published to the world—the post is eventually supposed to be published to the world, an order will not. So it diverges from the philosophy a little bit, but then I would try to use as many WordPress features as I can because it would allow our team to start quickly, prototype directly on top of it, and then once the product is successful, then we can worry about scale. We can worry about what we want to do exactly—or, well, not what we want to do, but what’s the best structure for it and how do we support our customers who are growing very well, how do we support our clients who are doing very well, and we should not get in the way of their growth just for our growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />The biggest challenge we have with databases is their size, I would say. Right? How big of a deal is it to have gigantic table sizes? I don’t know. We deal with 4 million rows, 6 million rows in post meta sometimes. Is that a big deal? Is that not so much? What would you say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So disk storage is not that much of a concern as big of a concern as memory is—like available memory is. MySQL will try to load everything into memory. It’ll try to load all the indexes into memory, and if allowed, it would load everything, which is fine, which works great for the case that MySQL does for us. As a database designer, it means that our indexes are smart. We are not normalizing data too much. For example, in post meta, you have this meta key and meta value. This meta key is repeated thousands of times because every order is going to have the same meta keys, right? By converting it to columns, you’re reducing the amount that MySQL needs to load because—this is kind of oversimplifying—but it doesn’t need to load that string anymore. It knows that this is this column; it knows that this column is called whatever, and it knows all the values that belong to this column.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the amount of data that MySQL will put into RAM decreases with this denormalization—it comes into play. I wouldn’t say that it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t say that the space doesn’t matter, or I wouldn’t say that the size of the database doesn’t matter. It does matter. So first, with a bigger database, MySQL needs to have… With a denormalized database such as post meta, it would need to put more data into the RAM. But then also when it queries the data, it needs to scan through more rows; it needs to filter through more rows. So that also slows different parts of your site down. It’s a concern, but you can solve it in the sense that… One option is you can throw money at the server, but at some point, it gets tricky because there’s some limit to it, or that limit can hit really fast, really soon when the data explodes. So it’s a concern, but it’s not a concern when you’re starting up, when you’re developing this new product—or this is just my very subjective opinion. Many people will disagree with that—but it’ll definitely be a concern as you grow. It’ll definitely be a concern as you start to grow, as you start to acquire more customers or more data. And yeah, it would be a problem eventually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Hopefully… In Danish, we call those luxury problems. Hopefully, if you’re making that many orders, you’re also making money, and hopefully enough of that is profit to be able to allocate to solving this issue. So I’m curious, how much extra RAM is necessary for the FTS indexes on a site with a million orders? Is there any calculation or preparation people should do to make sure MySQL won’t crash because it runs out of memory?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />I actually tried to measure it during my testing, but I wasn’t able to. MySQL would always use the same amount of RAM, but I think that’s because of the testing conditions that I wanted. That’s mostly because I wasn’t able to create this testing condition where it would load more data. Maybe it was doing something behind the scenes that wasn’t observable, but I suppose that it would definitely need more RAM. It cannot… Even though just because I wasn’t able to observe it doesn’t mean that it’s not loading more RAM, but what it internally does is that it creates these words. For example, in your address, if you have, say, &#8220;221B Baker Street,&#8221; then it’ll have this row &#8220;221B,&#8221; it’ll have this row &#8220;Baker,&#8221; it would have this row &#8220;Street,&#8221; and then in each of these rows, it would store IDs of all the different order IDs where &#8220;221B,&#8221; &#8220;Baker,&#8221; or &#8220;Street&#8221; come in. So it’s not inefficient, it’s actually… It’s quite a good data structure, as we trust the developers of MySQL. It’s a pretty good data structure. It should have some additional RAM requirements, but I do not know what that is, or at least in my testing or in my research that I did, I wasn’t able to find this exact number that I can point out that this is what it’s going to need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />If you were testing on WordPress.com too, that would make it more challenging—a big multisite, right? The database is shared?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />No, so for the RAM, I was actually testing it on my local setup to actually see how much the requirement increases so that I can actually figure out the memory used by that exact process. So that’s why I said that it should have some additional RAM requirements, but I wasn’t able to actually establish how much. I hope that MySQL would have some documentation somewhere that tells you this, but it would also really depend on how different your database is. For example, if all the customers live on Baker</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Street, it’s not going to be a lot because it would find those repetitions. If your customers live all across the world with different addresses, the natural language… If it’s not able to index those words properly, if everything is different, then it would have a lot more requirement than it would by just when the addresses are more normalized. So maybe the RAM requirements cannot be as straightforwardly established as we can do it for other data structures, but it’s efficient, I hope. I guess, all that we have seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Ideally, if you have a database that is two gigabytes, you have two gigabytes of RAM, right? Just load everything into memory, it’ll work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />But then, Mike, you did test it out, right? Did you notice anything about how much additional requirement it imposed on your server?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />So on this particular server, it’s huge—64 gigs of RAM—and there’s a lot of it allocated. I think over 30 gigs of RAM is allocated to MySQL, so we didn’t need to make any adjustments basically. One of the reasons I moved them to that host was so that they had plenty of room for growth because they get so many orders per day, and their live site and staging site share the same server. So I would’ve had to get them to buy an extra airplane because it’s a dedicated physical server. It’s a bit more complicated than just spinning up an extra instance. But I’m having a meeting with them actually this week, so if I get any… When I told them I was going to speak with you, they were really excited because stores at this level… When they don’t want to move away to something like Shopify or something else, when things are working, their team is well-versed in WooCommerce and is trained in it now. So they don’t want to migrate away. Having someone who is very much working inside of core and knows what new developments are on the horizon helps give them a lot of confidence that WooCommerce can scale and can handle their multimillion-dollar business. Those are probably the kind of customers WooCommerce wants to keep happy, you would think, for the benefits of keeping the project alive for the very long term, so that it fits customers of all sizes—just starting out and those who have the luxury problem of that kind of growth and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Do you see a future where WooCommerce would be a standalone version of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Currently, I think it’s too coupled. So anything can happen in the future—I won’t say that nothing is impossible—but I think currently WooCommerce is too coupled with WordPress to be standalone anytime soon, at least. We rely on WordPress to… For example, the product relies on WordPress a lot because they are a post type that does get published. But then we rely on WordPress for role-based access control. We rely on WordPress for the whole admin backend. We rely on WordPress for a lot of things. I think there is a very nice future for WooCommerce within the WordPress ecosystem and for the WordPress ecosystem itself. But I would not say that there would be a standalone WooCommerce soon enough, although I do not see it immediately, at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, the reason I ask has to do with what we were talking about and having these bigger clients come in. It’s hard for us as freelancers, for example, to come up with a big client and say to them why they wouldn’t migrate away from WooCommerce because they know that the concept of WooCommerce is… It is a plugin that is for WordPress, and WordPress is content management software that is more for… Well, it’s kind of strange to say that it is for blog posts and for running a blog, but it’s for so many things right now. But basically, what people understand when they have to make a decision is that they have these dedicated platforms that are just solely there for the purpose of having an online store. And then you have something that you attach to another thing, and that enables you to sell your products online as well. So it kind of makes it a little bit harder for us to sell the idea. Although honestly, WooCommerce is so popular right now that most of these big ones don’t even ask those questions anymore. But there are some numbers that say that WooCommerce is mostly spread in smaller stores than in bigger stores. So for people to make the jump and to decide about WooCommerce, wouldn’t it be better if you would be saying that you are installing WooCommerce and not WordPress? You know what I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />So this is something for the marketing team to really answer, but I don’t know. I’ve always seen WordPress as an asset because I understand that even for a person who is primarily here for commerce, who primarily wants to use WooCommerce for commerce, they would eventually want to publish their product. They would eventually want to have… Or maybe not everyone, but in a majority of cases, they would want to publish their products. They would want to do SEO on them. They would want to have good SEO for their site. They would want to have their site look beautiful, use nice themes. They would want to have a membership area, have customers’ accounts, my account pages, and all of those things. They are something that we derive from WordPress. Even if you take a look at a WooCommerce and WordPress installation as WooCommerce first, there are a lot of things that are essential for a commerce shop that we derive from WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The features that WooCommerce uses from WordPress are not small; it’s huge. We pretty much use almost all the functionality that WordPress has to offer. An e-commerce site will pretty much use all the functionality that WordPress has to offer. I think that’s an asset, right? Because not just the functionality, but it also means that there are more experts in the ecosystem. There is more knowledge in the ecosystem, there is a bigger community. There is so much that we gain from WordPress. If we had to make WooCommerce standalone, we would have to implement all these things again that we currently just get from WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />It would have to be a fork of WordPress and then put WooCommerce on top of it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Yep, yep. Something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I like to ask these questions that are challenging, that you haven’t had time to think about them before. I think that’s the most fun about it. If you had a magic wand, what would you change in WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />That’s an interesting one. So I do not have a magic wand—I really wish I did. As someone working on performance, I feel that currently people have to understand the platform a bit as they grow. For example, they would change servers, maybe they would migrate to different machines, they would integrate different technologies. There are some milestones that happen as you grow. This is the same, right? Migrating to a different server or a bigger server, integrating Elasticsearch, integrating some different technologies, figuring out if you’re at a stage where you want to look into horizontal scaling, and things like that. If I had a magic wand, I think I would make this super clear or I would have it done magically that, &#8220;Okay, now I need this,&#8221; so this just happens. &#8220;I need this,&#8221; this just happens. So again, this is with a caveat that this is my limited perspective, but I think people are not that worried about additional cost as they grow because as Mike says, it’s a luxury problem. You want to have these problems, but having to replatform is annoying. It’s a distraction away from your main business. It’s something… It’s a chore. So I wish that we had something that just scales you up as you go, figures out where you want to go, and just takes you there and everything is just perfect all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Some notices appearing on the dashboard saying, &#8220;Now that you have a thousand customers, this would be advisable,&#8221; or… Well, who knows? Maybe AI will come in and help some of these clients scale a little bit better because some of these issues are repeatable, so they’re all the same for all clients. It’s kind of like there should already be some tool out there that allows us to give some automatic tips on how to improve the store and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Maybe you just click on a button and you are now on the server that you need at that point in your growth journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Well, to my defense, I would say we need two, but one is an automatic one and the other is &#8220;hire an expert.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />For the &#8220;hire an expert.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you find that clients take for granted the technological resource portion of running a store? I find in my own experience that it’s like buying a car. They buy the car and they’re like, &#8220;This should just run forever, no matter how many people I’m putting in it, how much crap I want to transport.&#8221; And when things stop working, they get very confused. They’re like, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; And I say, &#8220;Well, you’ve got to maintain the thing. If your family has doubled in size, maybe you want to get a bigger car.&#8221; It’s something that I find that non-technical store owners just… It’s like a shock for them. Some elasticity is required in growth and rebuilding and stuff. I was wondering if you found something similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />I can understand that as a customer or as a user of the product, you may think that way. But as you mentioned, it’s not that simple. In India, there’s this thing called—we call it Chota</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hathi. It’s basically a small pickup truck, the miniature version of a pickup truck, and you can use it to haul and carry stuff from your warehouse to your frontend stores or whatever it is. When you start, you buy this Chota Hathi, and then you can outgrow it as you grow. Suddenly it’s not enough. You have to make too many rounds; you cannot carry that much stuff anymore, or you need to carry much more stuff. So you need to buy a bigger one. You need to buy a proper pickup truck. You need to eventually buy a fleet of them when you get super successful. It’s the same with WooCommerce as well. You can start with a very small investment, and then you can grow it as much as you can or as much as you want to. This is something that we are actually trying to… So we actually just published a blog post on, I think, Friday. It’s called &#8220;Scaling with WooCommerce,&#8221; which helps you with this path that when you start out, the principle of WooCommerce is that you can run it on a very small basic server, but it’ll take you to wherever you need to go with the help of magic wands, which we call experts in the community. That’s the main principle. This engine and this truck bed, that’s all you need, and you can add more of these if you need it. You can buy a bigger one, or… All sorts of vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, integrating other technologies, or whatever milestones there are, you can do that. That’s the focus from our side. But that said, I also understand that, &#8220;I buy a small truck and I expect it to carry everything for me forever.&#8221; The difference is that in a physical shop, it’s easy to see that you cannot fit more than 400 kgs or some unit of it more than that on this small truck. So you need to buy a new one, or you need to buy a bigger one, or you need to buy more of them. It’s not super clear in software because, in software, you click and something happens. So that’s something that is a perception that we want to tackle, but you will see that as you grow, even if you want a bigger truck or even if you want a fleet, it’ll give you a very nice return. You will be in charge of everything, and it’ll give you a much better return on your investment as you grow your business because these are the things that you are using to grow the business. So we are trying to change the perception of it. But yeah, I do understand that with software… Someone at least, even me, I just download it and it should take me to the moon, but that’s going to need a bit more work than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />That’s awesome. We do have a lot of experience with customers like that, who just expect things to work. And also the other way around—they don’t expect to pay that much because they thought it should work in the first place. Sometimes we go in and say, &#8220;Yeah, but this needs fine-tuning and this and that.&#8221; And they say, &#8220;Yeah, but then I have to spend money, and it doesn’t make any sense.&#8221; Well, it does make a lot of sense. In the blog post you were just talking about, &#8220;Scaling with WooCommerce,&#8221; it’s really about that. It’s about different ways you can scale and how your growth and how the profit that you have… How much you should spend some of that into scaling well. It’s a very hard lesson to give to people, and that’s why case studies are so important—to show people how others did and how directly relatable it is for websites that run faster, how it converts better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s measurable. That’s something that, for example, Mike also has on his website—a tool to calculate that. So it’s very obvious to us that this is relatable, but it’s sometimes hard to explain that to other people. Do you think WooCommerce needs to have more case studies of the bigger clients where we can really point to them and say, &#8220;Look, WooCommerce is used in this million-dollar company, it’s used on that website&#8221;? Because with WordPress, we do this a little bit—we do tell people who are the big institutions and companies who use WordPress. I personally think WooCommerce misses that a little bit. Do you think that’s the case as well? And I know this is more marketing than performance, but it’s sort of related, right? It’s like, &#8220;Look, this is a website that has a thousand orders a day; you can do it as well. So your decision with having five orders a day today is a good one because you can scale it to a thousand a day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />I think it would be helpful, yeah. So this is, as you said, marketing, but we do have customers that use WooCommerce on some crazy scales, and it could make a lot of sense to document their journey if they’re fine with it and tell people that they’re using it. Tell people what scale they have, how they’re managing it, what their average request times are, what their conversion is, and things like that. I think it would be helpful. Let me see if I can ask some people inside to see if we can do this sort of marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, I think it’s very important, and this is the first thing people ask us: &#8220;Yeah, but do you have any examples?&#8221; and all of that. Obviously, Mike, being an expert, is more oriented toward this performance tuning part of the business. Mike does a very great job in writing case studies and almost automatically selling the idea that if you increase performance, you gain in sales. And yeah, I think that’s a very important part, and WooCommerce, I think, misses that a little bit, which we should definitely be investing more in—talking about these clients that I’m talking about. I’ve worked with some of them as well, and some of them… WooCommerce coming over to Codeable and asking for freelancers to work on these bigger clients because they have these bigger challenges. I was surprised to know, &#8220;Oh, this business? I know this business,&#8221; and I’m not living in the USA, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’m not supposed to know all the small, medium businesses and names that they have over there that have ads on the television and all of that. So there’s a culture around the businesses that is more US-oriented than in the rest of the world. But there are some other names who come over to this side of the world, and they get their brands and names over here. Some of them I say, &#8220;Oh, this website runs WooCommerce? Oh, that website runs WooCommerce?&#8221; So it’s kind of a surprise for me, and I question… It shouldn’t be a surprise for me as it shouldn’t be a surprise for anybody else. I think there’s something that needs to be done in terms of telling everybody, like all the other competing platforms do, right? They do announce who the brands are that are using them. I think it’s very beneficial if they would do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I’ve found the challenge is often that… With the Shark Tank client, they made me sign an NDA. They don’t want me to publicize who they are because once it’s a business, there’s money involved, there’s competition, and people are always looking for a technical edge or a way to… &#8220;How are they doing it?&#8221; If you keep your competitors stuck on trying to figure out the technical puzzle, it takes away their resources from being able to compete in other areas that might be challenging for you to keep up with. So I think part of it, unfortunately, is just business and the nature of it, and trying to keep things competitive and keep your profit margins and your market share. It’s way easier for me to get people who just use WordPress for the blog or the content production… They’re happy to brag about how many visits they’re getting and how much things got better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as soon as they’re selling a product, it becomes… Yeah, they seem way more hesitant. So maybe giving them incentives might help. I think that making this connection with the WooCommerce core team helps provide a… Like, &#8220;Hey, we’d like to share your story. You’ll still be anonymous, but we’d like to get some numbers out there.&#8221; It helps build some trust, I think, and confidence in WooCommerce as a product for the long term. We’ll see if we can help make something like that happen. I don’t know if you experience that as well, Marcel, with… If you want to write a case study or publish things that… They’re like, &#8220;Hey, you can say…&#8221; I change the names, and I usually don’t use the company name unless they say it’s okay. And it’s very rare that they say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, there’s this concern about giving away some critical information that they took months or years to accumulate. Then simply there’s another developer who comes in and just talks about all the tricks and all the things that… Sometimes, Mike, they don’t even want to tell that it is you who worked on this particular feature because then other companies and competitors will come to you and say, &#8220;Hey, but I’ll pay double if you do the same thing for me,&#8221; and stuff like that. I understand that, but at the same time, WooCommerce is also a business, I would say, because they want advertising in terms of what clients use, what companies use WooCommerce. Two businesses talk to each other, and as you said, Mike, they will compensate for giving away that information to each other. I think there’s… Yeah, it’s a challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have obviously this challenge,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and we have NDAs, and we are more strict about talking about it because we know the nitty-gritty, and we know all the tricks, and we know what we did with the website. It would help immensely others who are struggling to scale their online shops to know how the others did it, right? That’s the whole secret about maintaining a business: &#8220;How are those guys selling ten times more than we are? What are they doing? Why is it that their website is loading in 200 milliseconds and mine is two seconds?&#8221; Yeah, I understand how challenging that can be, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Especially if you talk about scale—how many orders you are getting—it gives your competitor a direct idea of the exact revenue that you’re making, right? Or it at least gives them a ballpark, which is pretty sensitive to give away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />And what Marcel was saying too, that there are clients that don’t want me to even announce which industry they are working in because they’re like, &#8220;You’re my secret sauce. You’re my competitive advantage, and I don’t want other people to know that you’re helping me.&#8221; Then they’re going to offer you money—double, triple, or whatever—to do the same stuff. It’s tricky. It’s very flattering; it’s a very nice compliment. But at the same time, I think when you get into freelancing and helping WooCommerce stores with performance and user experience and all of that, you’re interested in making the internet a more enjoyable place for people to shop and do stuff. If you’re sort of restricted to doing that for fewer people, it feels weird—it doesn’t feel like you’re fulfilling your mission, I guess, in the same way as you’d ideally like to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />100%, definitely. Vedanshu, we would have a thousand more questions to ask you. We would probably get much more technical in our questions than our audience would like us to get. But we would like to thank you very much for participating in today’s episode. It was a pleasure having you. We’re definitely going to keep in contact because, yeah, this is what we love to do. We love to have these connections with people who are, first of all, smarter than we are; secondly, who know about what’s coming in the future and what’s happening with WooCommerce; and thirdly, because you’re very friendly and very helpful in answering our questions. This is something that we all benefit from, and therefore we thank you for your participation today. It was a pleasure having you on the episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Thank you so much. The pleasure was all mine. I wouldn’t say anything on the &#8220;smarter&#8221; bit because I think you’re all much smarter than me. But yeah, it was a pleasure being here, talking to you, and you’re all friendly too, so yeah, it makes for a nice time. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Alright, thank you so much for listening. This is our first guest that we are bringing on this new edition of Woo Have Chat. We’re going to have other guests coming up. Yeah, this is just the beginning of it, right, Mike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Warm-up? Yeah, yeah. During this recording, I was thinking that Vedanshu is like a performance hero. He’s helping speed up WooCommerce across countless stores, and I think we need to have more friendly, approachable, passionate performance heroes on the show and have them share their experience and stuff. So I hope you’re okay with that title. We can get you a cape if you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu:<br />Please, please. I would go and buy a cape right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />What color should it be? Purple? WooCommerce purple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Probably, yeah, probably. Alright, we want to thank you so much for listening, and we’ll see you in the next episode.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo DevChat</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Marcel</strong> and <strong>Mike</strong> dive deep into the world of WooCommerce performance and scalability with <strong>Vedanshu Jain,core developer and key contributor to the WooCommerce project at Automattic</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vedanshu shares his insights on High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS), a game-changing feature designed to help WooCommerce stores handle massive volumes of orders without compromising speed. We discuss the importance of planning for growth, the challenges of adopting new technologies, and how WooCommerce can compete with dedicated e-commerce platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re building a small store or a high-traffic site, this episode is packed with valuable tips on future-proofing your WooCommerce projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage):</strong> HPOS is designed to improve the scalability and performance of WooCommerce stores by storing order data in separate tables instead of the default WordPress posts and post meta tables. This approach helps large-scale operations run smoothly without slowing down the site as orders increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Scalability:</strong> For new WooCommerce stores, starting with HPOS is recommended to prepare for future growth, while existing stores should consider migrating to avoid potential performance issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges with Adoption:</strong> Despite its benefits, some store owners may hesitate to activate HPOS due to concerns about potential disruptions, especially on live sites. WooCommerce addresses this by offering rollback mechanisms and guides to ensure a safe transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance Enhancements:</strong> The WooCommerce team continually works on performance improvements, such as introducing full-text search (FTS) indexes in MySQL, which significantly speeds up search queries on large datasets. These enhancements undergo extensive testing before being recommended for widespread use to ensure stability and reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Real-World Testing and Feedback</strong>: Features like FTS indexes are initially released as experimental to gather real-world feedback and identify edge cases before being marked as stable. The WooCommerce team relies on testing both in controlled environments and on real, high-traffic sites to ensure the robustness of new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WooCommerce vs. Dedicated E-commerce Platforms: </strong>WooCommerce’s integration with WordPress offers many advantages, including flexibility and access to a vast ecosystem of plugins and themes. However, there is a perception challenge when comparing WooCommerce, which is a WordPress plugin, with dedicated e-commerce platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marketing and Communication</strong>: To combat the perception that WooCommerce is only suitable for smaller stores, the platform could benefit from highlighting successful large-scale implementations through case studies. These would play a crucial role in showcasing WooCommerce’s capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Importance of Planning for Growth</strong>: As stores grow, they need to plan for increased server resources, potential platform changes, and other scaling challenges. Early planning can help avoid stress and ensure smooth growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges in Sharing Success Stories</strong>: While case studies can be valuable, many successful businesses are reluctant to share details due to competitive reasons, including revealing their technical strategies and performance enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WooCommerce’s Future Direction</strong>: WooCommerce is deeply integrated with WordPress, and while there are no immediate plans to separate it, the team is focused on enhancing its scalability and performance within the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Links</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedanshuj/\">Vedanshu on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vedjain/\">Vedanshu on WordPress.org</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/high-performance-order-storage/\">High-Performance Order Storage Documentation on Woo</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2024/08/22/scaling-with-woocommerce/\">Scaling with WooCommerce</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-search.html\">Full-Text Search Functions with MySQL</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 09:08:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #106 – Gutenberg 19.0, 19.1, WordPress 6.7 and Outreach channel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=29895\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-106-gutenberg-19-0-19-1-wordpress-6-7-outreach/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59856:\"<p>In this episode, Jessica Lyschik and Birgit Pauli-Haack discuss Gutenberg 19.0, 19.1, WordPress 6.7, Outreach channel, and Twenty-Twenty-Five Default theme</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-106-gutenberg-19-0-19-1-wordpress-6-7-outreach/#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-106-gutenberg-19-0-19-1-wordpress-6-7-outreach/transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Developer Hours</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3Zs3NOTLt4&list=PL1pJFUVKQ7ETApyQQlt3pLNjPx2HrQwl5&index=1&pp=iAQB\">Developer Hours: Hello, Blocks!

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 19.0, 19.1, WordPress 6.7, and some other stuff. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project sponsored by Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With me today as co-host is Jessica Lyschik from Greyd, core contributor and theme wizard, and one of the people you&#8217;ll find often in the WordPress Outreach channel discussing block themes and other topics. It&#8217;s wonderful to have you, Jessica. Thank you for taking the time. How are you today and how was your summer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, thanks for having me, Birgit. I&#8217;m doing good. My summer was nice so far. It&#8217;s a bit hot outside, so I&#8217;m here in the cool area, so that&#8217;s all good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I just recently looked at the&#8230; So I&#8217;m pretty much also, it&#8217;s very hot. It&#8217;s about 29 degrees inside, 31 outside Celsius, and I was just comparing it to Florida because I lived there for 25 years and I found that the advantage here in Munich is that in the night, it gets really colder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It cools off about eight degrees. So I looked at the weather in Florida even at night they have 25, 24 degrees, and here we have about 16 or 15 degrees Celsius, so it&#8217;s all bearable. And a night owl like me can certainly survive this one here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I&#8217;m a night owl too. So in the evening, it&#8217;s a bit more chilly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. So Jessica, you have been on the show before. This is your third time, but for our new listeners, would you tell us briefly what you&#8217;re working on and how you contribute to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, sure. So Birgit has actually introduced me quite well already. So I&#8217;m working at Greyd on the products that enhance not just the block editor, but also a lot of stuff to improve your workflows in managing a WordPress website. So I do everything from support, to bug fixes, to new features like the whole package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m also a WordPress core contributor and have worked on the Twenty Twenty Four theme last year. So it&#8217;s now been a year since then. And apparently I appear way too often on the outreach channel on Slack, and I hope that not every time people are rolling their eyes because I have asked another question there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, it&#8217;s quite the opposite actually, and I just mentioned it because I don&#8217;t think we talked on this show before on the outreach program that merged into a broader scope than it was with the full site editing. And it&#8217;s a channel where Nick Diego, Justin Tadlock, myself, and Ryan Welcher actually hang out on the WordPress Slack to answer questions, connect with extenders that build products on top of WordPress or know coders that do theme building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so if you have questions or if you think something isn&#8217;t right or if you just wonder, okay, I don&#8217;t know, is it supposed to work like that or is it a bug? And to figure that out, it&#8217;s very hard to do a bug report when you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s supposed to work like that or not. So we figure it out together. And so answering questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you come, you actually are part of the feedback loop back to the developers as well to say, okay, if Jessica&#8217;s confused, it&#8217;s confused for other people too, or you&#8217;re also an early warning system. Jessica the canary. So keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. It helps you probably both in your work as well as in our work, and I want to encourage a lot of other people to come to the channel and hang out. We don&#8217;t bite. We answer every question and we hope you get better at whatever you want to do. So that&#8217;s why I mentioned it before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> And I&#8217;m the one who asks the most questions, I feel like, in this channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Sometimes. Well, that depends on what you&#8217;re working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s actually true. So sometimes it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s something, a feature we would like to add in our product and it&#8217;s like, hmm, how is core handling that? Is that actually right? Or should this be different? Is that a bug? Is that a bug in our end in our product? Can we reproduce this with just for default theme and WordPress core itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And oftentimes it&#8217;s a bit unsure, is it really supposed to work like that? So I had multiple questions of these and I got them answered all. I think there was one or two that were too broad and maybe not in depth from my side, which is totally okay. But in general, I can say has always been an answer at some point, and if not, then just keep iterating on it. So keep asking again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it works very well in the outreach channel. Just also from my perspective as an extender, I think it&#8217;s super valuable to have this channel so I can just discuss this in turn with my colleagues and then, okay, we don&#8217;t know what to do next or where the culprit is so we can ask core contributors and maybe other people have ideas. So I have helped out also other people that had questions where I knew the answer to, so I help them out as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And sometimes it&#8217;s not just something that doesn&#8217;t work right or it&#8217;s quirky or something like that. It&#8217;s more like how do you approach it in working with that particular API and having multiple voices in one channel actually helps really figuring it out for yourself or for myself, but also gives a better input or feedback on what are the use cases, special features will come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have new APIs for the plugins and can do templates that are editable in this site editor when we talk about it a little later today with the 19.1 release. But that is certainly something that needs to be discussed with a few people. There&#8217;s also a GitHub group, it&#8217;s called WordPress/Outreach, where about 22 people extenders have said, &#8220;Okay, if you ping us with that handle, we are ready to give feedback on certain new features and a discussion on issue on GitHub or on a PR.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we can close the feedback loops a little bit or make the feedback loops a little bit closer and a little bit more interactive during development and even afterwards. Well, that&#8217;s a little excursion, the outreach channel, so join us there. You definitely need a Slack account and you need a WordPress.org account, but other than that, it&#8217;s easy access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are at the announcements space on this podcast and it&#8217;s been a while since our last show with Ellen Bauer, so let&#8217;s catch up on a few things. So there were two more developer hours that happened last month. One was on Hello Blocks, an introduction to block development. It&#8217;s not about new features, it&#8217;s about if you haven&#8217;t yet started getting into block development, I think Ryan Welcher was there how to get started, how to approach it, what are the things to learn, and I think they did a great job in putting that all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we also had one last week that was the building WordPress themes with the Create Block Theme plugin, and Tammie Lister showed us how she works with that plugin in her theme development process. And it was a great insight also because you also talked about style variations, what works and what doesn&#8217;t work and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the recordings are up on YouTube and of course, we&#8217;ll share all the links in the show notes including the link to the developer hours YouTube playlist, so you can go back and listen to the other 25 developer hours that have been done since, I think, last year. Have you listened to any of those developer hours? Not necessarily those two, but others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I think I&#8217;ve attended a few in the past, so these two were&#8230; I&#8217;m also already too advanced for this, so I skipped them, but I think for new people or people just starting out or not knowing where to start, I think these are pretty good starter sessions to get into to learn the vocabulary that we use and just to see how do things work and maybe then experiment on top of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Exactly, yeah. It&#8217;s hard to get into all the different audiences. Yeah, they are low-code people, there are developer people, so this is definitely for developers that touch code and more than for no-code or low-code site builders. There are two releases, WordPress releases coming up. There&#8217;s a minor release, a maintenance release coming up with WordPress 6.6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release candidate one is scheduled for September 4th and the full release is planned for September 10th. And block editor wise, there is mostly some touch up on the CSS specificity that came out with 6.6 and got a few sites struggling with that. And though the bugs are coming through and we share the link to the release post so you can look up on the track tickets what else is in that maintenance release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.7</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second release coming up is WordPress 6.7, the major release and WordPress beta one is scheduled for Tuesday, November 1st.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> October 1st.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> November 1st, I wish. October 1st. Thank you so much for pointing that out for me. It&#8217;s right there. But the reading at the brain&#8230; It&#8217;s only now it&#8217;s only four weeks away and the last Gutenberg plugin that&#8217;s going to push features into that release will be 19.3. So there are two more Gutenberg plugin releases to come. And then we know what actually made it into 6.7 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a project board for the editor task, and a couple of weeks ago, there was a hallway hangout with demos of what&#8217;s next for Gutenberg and it showed some demos from the developers how the new tabs block comes along, how a new accordion block comes along, how the image gallery light box is supposed to work, then how the UI for custom fields going to look like with the block bindings together and with the sync patterns overrides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s also a free form cropping tool that people are working on. I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s going to make it for 6.7, but it&#8217;s definitely worth looking at it because it&#8217;s better than what is there now. And then there were status updates on data views on the zoomed out mode, on the grid layout, and also on background images for block support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are things that we don&#8217;t have a roadmap for WordPress 6.7 yet it probably will be published with a source of truth that Anne McCarthy puts out, and there probably won&#8217;t be a prior WordPress roadmap for WordPress 6.7. So we&#8217;ll definitely keep you informed. Anything that stood out for you, Jessica, that you&#8217;re excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: 6.7 will also ship with a new default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Good point. That was not on the Hallway Hangout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Because I think the Hallway Hangout happened before the introduction post got online I think something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: So new default theme. So Twenty Twenty Four will have its last days. Nah, just kidding. Twenty Twenty Five will be coming, yes. Yeah, design is up. The work has already started and I haven&#8217;t checked in this week, I was a bit busy. But so far, what I&#8217;ve been seeing looks pretty good. It&#8217;s like progress is made. They have a few more weeks than we did last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year we had only four, now they have seven, so they have a bit more time to polish things, but I think overall the design is pretty straightforward. It has some nice features in it, but it&#8217;s not too advanced that it super much relies on features to be implemented. I know Carolina has been working on post formats as well, but I don&#8217;t think that these will make it actually. So I think there&#8217;s some more feedback needed or some more iterations needed on that, but overall the theme just looks great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. And the listeners, we will share the introduction post that was on the make core block, I think it was&#8230; Yeah, I&#8217;ll find it. I didn&#8217;t put it in the list here. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No worries, that&#8217;s why you have me here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, right. You are more in tune than what happened in the last four weeks than I was because I was on vacation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Everyone deserves a vacation, so that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so I also saw that Carolina, and we&#8217;re talking about Carolina Nymark who was here two episodes before on the show. She is also facilitating weekly meetings for contributors to the default Twenty Twenty Five theme because there is a call for contributors for creating style variations as well as patterns. And so if you want to contribute to that or just see what&#8217;s happening about it, just follow the core Slack block for the theme meetings for the default theme so you know what&#8217;s up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Create Block Theme<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are at the stage what actually was released, and before we go into Gutenberg, let&#8217;s talk about the Create Block Theme plugin. I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;re actually using that because you&#8217;re more into code and not going from the site to use the theme and back and forth again, but that&#8217;s what you can do with Create Block Theme plugin. You can make all the design changes and decisions on a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can clone a theme, you can start an empty theme from scratch, or you can create a child theme with that plugin directly from your admin for the admin pages or for the site from the site editor. And then you can save the changes that are made through the site editor that are stored in the database, be pulled out into your file system, so being changes for colors or style variations or all that, you can then export it into your theme file system and then use that update so you can use it on a different site as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s actually a process that quite a few theme developers use, especially also those that work for Automattic. There was a Hallway Hangout where Beatrice Fialho, who also is the designer of the Twenty Twenty Five theme, has demonstrated her workflow from using the site editor to pull in a theme into Playground and then use the plugin to get it out of it into and then push it to GitHub as a pull request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was really cool. And you don&#8217;t need to know code pretty much, you can all do it through Playground. But the Create Block Theme plugin is sometimes a little bit behind core because all the new features need to land in core and then it needs to be decided. Okay, how can Block Theme plugin&#8230; God, this hard?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> It&#8217;s all worse than one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Create Block Theme plugin help, no coders or theme builders to get everything out again into a theme that is reusable. So there&#8217;s a new global style, JSON data inspector. There&#8217;s also an update on the black theme, theme JSON. Then the side bar because when you install it&#8217;s installed, it has the side bar in the side editor, but on classic themes you don&#8217;t have the site bar. So it&#8217;s disabled for classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can still use it through the admin pages, and now they had to bump up the minimum required WordPress version to 6.6. So if you use that Create Block Theme plugin, I will cluster the links in the show notes with the developer hours with Tammie Lister, the link to the plugin, and also to the Hallway Hangout recap where we have the demo, how the plugin Playground and GitHub can work together to put it also in version control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was complicated. I thought it would be easier, but maybe it&#8217;s just me who made it complicated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 19.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, Gutenberg 19.0, 206 PRs merged by 50 contributors including five first-time contributors. Fabulous. Great work. So what&#8217;s new? Yeah, no fear. We will not read all 206 PRs. We only grab a few of those as most of you know, do you want to start Jessica?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I think we can directly start with one of the enhancements, which is font format library at old edit field to inline image, which basically means when you have added an inline image to a paragraph for example, then you can also now add an alternative text, which was previously not possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there was only that you could adjust the width but not add anything else. And maybe sometimes it would be helpful to have an alternative text there, especially for accessibility reasons. So that&#8217;s actually a really cool change. It&#8217;s tiny, but it&#8217;s really helping. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, just to clarify, I totally agree with you. It&#8217;s tiny, but a very good enhancement. If the image has an alt text in the media library, it automatically was pulled but you weren&#8217;t able to change it. So that&#8217;s why the edit field was added to it. So if somebody uploaded it without an alt text, you couldn&#8217;t edit it unless you go back to the media library and edit it, remove it from the canvas and then put it in again. So this is not so much…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, sometimes it will be usable or exactly using that case to have no alternative text when it&#8217;s just something, a visual indicator. So there&#8217;s no need for an alternative text. But as you said, when you can only change it from what&#8217;s in the media library then it makes no sense because sometimes you would need it and sometimes maybe even not. Now you can really apply an alternative text or not if you don&#8217;t need it. So you have now both options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, decorative imaging doesn&#8217;t need an alt text, but yes, cool. For the gallery link controls, they are now in the block toolbar. So because the link controls not only has, you could either put a link on the image or you can enable the click to increase and those two things were separated, so you could actually do both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can only do either one of them, which makes sense because you can only do a one click action on the image. So that&#8217;s why those things are now combined and you find them in the block toolbar and not in the side bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a pretty good user experience enhancement. So I really like that. I actually haven&#8217;t seen this before, but good to have it pointed out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So on the navigation block, the system now hides the overlay menu, that&#8217;s the mobile menu. If the block is selected so it gets out of your way. The navigation block gets quite a few incremental changes and improvements, but this one is definitely&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s all a little bit clustered and we find in other releases that or that they&#8217;re working on is removing or moving stuff around. So the navigation block will have some additional small improvements, quality of life improvements, which are definitely necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Border block support, yay. More posts receive borders, yay. I mean it sounds super hard, but it&#8217;s actually, I don&#8217;t think where Borders started out which block it was just a few, couple blocks, but it makes sense to have them at more blocks available because sometimes you want to style and a block with borders when your layout needs it, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So otherwise, you would have to put it in a group before and now you can just style it on the block itself just like you can do in CSS basically. And I think borders is a really nice example where it makes sense to add it to a lot of blocks. So there are a couple of more that got border block support in 19.0. So mostly post-related blocks, post-date, post-term, post-title, so and then we have site tagline, site title, table of contents. It&#8217;s not published yet, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, table of contents is in the plugin, but it&#8217;s not in the core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> It&#8217;s in the plugin, right? It&#8217;s not in core yet. Exactly. Is Time To Read in core already? I&#8217;m not sure, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No. There were some accessibility issues with Time To Read and also the exclusivity it makes you feel bad when you take longer than the Time To Read puts out there. So there were some concerns in that both are in the Gutenberg plugin definitely, but now they have border support, so if you use them in production, it&#8217;s always interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were some tweaks on the tag cloud controls and description there were nice because it&#8217;s a little bit more organized in the side bar and how the design is cleaned up and it also has the feature smallest to largest. You can now put the side, it&#8217;s a little bit more organized and also has a better description. The next one is the list block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, the list block seems to got a bunch of improvements there. I&#8217;m just trying to figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Change the numbering style to something much more recognizable like a list style and then move the style controls up to the start value controls. So it&#8217;s also the user interface for that. Change the longer title to just for reverse list numbering to just reverse, which would be definitely equally understandable, I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then remove the default background color control to the list item, which is very nice. I like that because then you can do your own stripe design if you want to And it changed the default icon size to the, what is that? 40 pixels. That&#8217;s something that some of the interface items have a different size than others and I think the standardized is to go for 40 pixels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I have seen this change now across the change logs recently, so I think there&#8217;s some unification there going on to make them all the same size. So you know where do you expect to click in. That makes total sense. No, that&#8217;s actually pretty good improvement. So it&#8217;s, again, just tiny and probably not the next big feature, but it&#8217;s definitely user experience improvement. That&#8217;s cool to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, there is a Gutenberg polish board that has been around for I think three versions and contributors are getting finally a little bit more through that to make all those changes. So I like that there&#8217;s revisit some of the design choices and unify them exactly, especially because there are new things coming in the data views and it would be helpful when they were all standardized as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the features in the Gutenberg 19.0 is additional data use extensibility. So it allows now to unregister permanent delete post actions or unregister restore post action or unregister trash post action. That is for site owners or site builders that want to put some guardrails around those state of use actions to help the clients not to get lost or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Destroy site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Save them for themselves. Yeah, destroy their site, yes. But it also opens it up. I think it&#8217;s another, it&#8217;s also coming, if it&#8217;s under 19.1, it&#8217;s definitely a 19.2 is that it opens up that particular piece also for third-party additional bug action. So I think that&#8217;s the way to where it goes, where it&#8217;s heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I think we need this also because the true power of WordPress previously when you use the old style backend, it&#8217;s extensibility. So you could add whatever you needed to work with whatever plugin, functionality was provided. And I think if we lose this then WordPress will lose its user base. That sounds now very harsh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: It&#8217;s like little steps in that direction and I think when we have this extensibility overall that when we keep this, it was on the old-school WordPress if you will, then I think that&#8217;s only the pathway forward because what made WordPress so big is the fact that you can make everything out of it so it&#8217;s so extensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many plugins, there&#8217;s so much functionality you can use with it and if you just do not allow these things, I think this is also where people struggle sometimes where agencies struggle to get the stuff in and we struggle great with that sometimes. So the more, the better of extensibility possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>As a side note, there is now a tracking issue in Gutenberg repository about the most important extensibility issues for certain areas and so that would be really great, and I will share the link in the show notes, would be really great to get more input on each of those issues in terms of use case and why it&#8217;s really important for a certain use case to have that extensibility feature in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share the link in the show notes, but it&#8217;s also something that will be more and more also discussed in the outreach channels and it&#8217;s not so much about the data views because I think, so the Gutenberg developers definitely know that the data views will not come to WordPress permanently unless they are extendable to the same or similar grade as it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one approach is should we replicate the hooks and the filters or should we see, because there&#8217;s another level there, is the user can also make decisions on certain things. So that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s really important for the site editor and the block editor to get the extensibility with that in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the data views, it&#8217;s not that important because the extensibility is a given point, but it doesn&#8217;t have the user changing things too much around except for maybe changing the column or changing which fields are displayed are all things that haven&#8217;t been done yet previously to WordPress. So it&#8217;s coming in additional features, but the extensibility certainly will come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about the next thing on the changelog, that&#8217;s the heading that&#8217;s enable heading level curation. So that is a PR where you can, as a developer, give your clients, your site creators, certain headers that you can only use as default. So one example is why do we have the H1 in that list when you are not supposed to have more than one H1 heading on the page, which is now the site title for now default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So every other heading should be H2, which works, but then there are other things as well where you say, okay, for the editor, we can only have H3s because all the other things are dynamically graded. So that was definitely one of those extensibility issues for the editor that came out of a conversation with extenders who have hundreds and hundreds of sites on their multi-site system to give them a way to have additional guardrails for their users, their students or faculty members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: That&#8217;s a very good change. I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And with it actually also comes a new option called level option attribute for other core blocks like the post title, the query title, site title, and the site tagline where you can also control the available heading levels for your custom blocks or your block variations if you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, that makes sense to extend that to these blocks as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Because that&#8217;s where the headings come in on a dynamic level. Then what comes out of conversations had in the hallway tracks of WordCamp, I think since we have WordCamp&#8217;s now more and more and these conversations happen quite frequently and they&#8217;ll also make it into core quite rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what&#8217;s the next one? I highlighted add the radio scale, but I think that&#8217;s the slider for the border radius. You can now add a scale to it through the components. So that is definitely a developer related thing. So you have radius X small, radius small, radius medium, radius large, so you can have presets for your bottle radius I think through the components. That&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And do you want to take the select controls?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Well, they seem to be very much technical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, we can skip that. It&#8217;s definitely for…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I think we can skip that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s for developers that use the select control. If you have that in your plugins or products, go back and see how that might change how you work with it. It&#8217;s all backwards compatible so don&#8217;t fear. So the next one, I&#8217;m in school, I think we are almost done with 19.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I think I highlighted one that I found quite interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Did I skip it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> It&#8217;s in the accessibility section, there has been a PR to move the post per page offset and pages controls from the block toolbar into the inspector controls and we&#8217;re now talking about the query loop block. So previously, or as of now you have to, when you want to adjust what the query loop is outputting the number of posts per page, if there should be an offset and these things, you have it in a block toolbar and now they got all moved to the setting side bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think this is a change that probably will leave people confused if they do not hear about it or they will search for those. Where is that toggle? I need to change the number of posts. So I just wanted to highlight that one because that&#8217;s what I stumbled upon as well and I thought, ooh. I mean, it&#8217;s not a bad change makes sense to move them to the site bar, but if you are not aware of it that things are moving around, then it might be confusing to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Totally correct to call that out, especially because the side bar is not automatically opened. When you select the block, so you need to have another click and open the side bar settings for that. And I think it also was moved to the inspector controls, which is the technical term for side bar, because there is also additional features are coming for that and it would be combined with those options for the query loop. Yeah, good point. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have another one and we talked about it, but I just wanted to see that there is also a hook to allow for the data view sustainability. There&#8217;s also a hook to allow third-party scripts to register and unregister post type actions that is combined with what we previously talked about the same, the extensibility of the data views and I think that was it all, the Gutenberg 19.0 and we are moving right into Gutenberg 19.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 19.1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So vacation time, you see they have only 178 PRs merged by 46 contributors. The release post is out and Artemio Morales was the release lead for this one. Let&#8217;s talk about the enhancements. There are some quick edit actions for the data views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Just as quick edit actions, but I guess it&#8217;s related to data views and the linked issues, it says data views. Oh my god, so many changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the data views, so you don&#8217;t have to open up the post to change the post status. So you can publish or put it in draft or move it forward or change the date right from the data view list and I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s just like replicating what we have or what we are used to from the traditional post overview to exactly in the data views to&#8230; When you see something familiar, it just gets easier to adapt to the different look, but it works the same when you use it. Of course, under the hood it&#8217;s a bit different, but I think the user experience when it&#8217;s fairly similar to what we are used to, I think people will quickly adapt to the new interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I totally agree with you, but the interface looks so much more modern so it&#8217;s actually delightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Absolutely, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And part of the extensibility again, so there is some great work being done and very pushed forward. There&#8217;s also unregistering, duplicate post actions patterns, unregistered duplication from template part actions or rename or reorder page or view post actions and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can definitely, as a plugin developer, when you use those data views, you can pretty much make your own defaults for that and use it as you need it for your plugins. So the image block has a reset button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I think this is also an interesting change. It looks, again, one of these tiny changes, but when you have added an image block before and then selected an media either from your library or from URL, you could never reset the block to this initial state where you have this white box with the three buttons and now you can because the reset option has been added to where you replace those, where you can replace the media, you can reset it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in case you want to change the image to something else but don&#8217;t have the new image ready yet, you can just delete it, but leave the image block as placeholder there so you know when you come back that you can edit again. I think this is, again, a tiny change, but I think it could be a great quality of life improvement for many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely, yeah. You can go back to where you started off and that&#8217;s always a good place when you make decisions, you have buyer’s remorse for that and you can just go back and say, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Maybe I have changed the aspect ratio or whatever other changes you&#8217;ve made and you need to start over again. It&#8217;s now as simple as clicking into a menu element and not having to delete the block and then add a new block again, which has more clicks than just resetting it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. And also staying with the image block, there&#8217;s now an overlay with a text shadow possible for the image, so the caption can be on top of the image instead of underneath if you wanted to or it&#8217;s now automatically there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> And the background is not as harsh as it used to be, so when you have added the caption to the image, there was always this big black hole or this gradient that was in your face and probably did not match many layouts I guess. So that&#8217;s probably why people didn&#8217;t use it and now it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s still there but it&#8217;s much lighter and it&#8217;s not that harsh at the bottom of the image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, there&#8217;s an art in painting. There is this kind of, don&#8217;t use the black-black thing because it burns a hole in your canvas for a person that&#8217;s going to look at it. That&#8217;s a similar design move there to not be so harsh on certain backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> We have some updates to other blocks. I think highlighting the quote block first is something interesting. So the quote block didn&#8217;t have alignment controls, so you couldn&#8217;t left align, right align, center width, full width and wide width.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right? Yeah. It was the full width and align wide width that wasn&#8217;t available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, exactly. And I think this has something to do also with the pull quote block from what I roughly remember, but you can now fully align this to whatever you need the quote block to, especially like that it&#8217;s left and right alignable, so you have that in the text, you have this quote block and then the text floats around it. I think this can be very useful. It&#8217;s not here&#8217;s an entire block splitting up your content, but it&#8217;s actually a bit more usable in this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I really like the right or left alignment because you can pull out some of the quotes from a text and make it a little bit more stand out instead of just using a subheader or something like that. So yeah, pretty cool. And now we get some more board support for more blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all the comment blocks, comment, author content and date have now border controls, as does the post author bio name and the full author parent block and then the query title and the query loop, the query title can have borders for the file block. The list items block. That is actually pretty cool because then now you can do underlined line items. That&#8217;s really cool. And then also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> And alternating it with the background to have also distinct border. Then not just the background color but also have a distinct border in between. Oh, that&#8217;s very nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Exactly, exactly. Yeah, and then you can do it also on the full list. Let us stand out and have a border also for the preformatted block and the tag cloud. They all have now border support in the Gutenberg plugin with the 19.1 release. This release also has a few updates for the zoomed out feature. Have you tried the zoom out feature yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Not yet. I&#8217;ve been seeing things around, but I haven&#8217;t really gotten into testing it out yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So when you use patterns, it will click on a pattern. It now can recede the whole canvas into a full page view so to speak. That&#8217;s the zoomed out one. There&#8217;s also a zoomed out. I don&#8217;t know exactly when that happens. Sometimes it&#8217;s triggered and now there is a drop-down also on where you do the preview and the mobile and the preview new tab. There&#8217;s also a new drop-down on the zoomed out or zoom in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can see, okay, when I want to put in a new section, how does that change my whole feel for the whole page? And that&#8217;s actually a great feature, but it has a few pitfalls. Can I edit when I&#8217;m in that mode? And so the block insertion points needed to be handled differently, clear out or changed when you select a different block or section and then the default inserter to the patterns tab when in zoom out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So you will see when the pattern, when you&#8217;re zoomed out mode and you click on the insertor, you first see the pattern displayed because there is the idea that if you are in zoomed out mode, you want to add bigger sections and you need a bigger view on that. It&#8217;s kind of those assumptions all need to be tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it would be really cool to have more testing being done and get some more opinions and feedback about it, how that changes your flow when you work it on a day-to-day basis. And there is actually a call for testing out for that by Anne McCarthy. No, she has block binding, sorry. And now she definitely wants you to test us in the outreach channel. She posted that, so get on it, Jessica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I guess. I&#8217;m not so sure the next two weeks will be a bit tough, so probably after WorldCamp US maybe where I think we&#8217;ll be almost too late to actually test this, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s going to make it to 6.7. There is a full push for it to get it in .7, but I don&#8217;t know yet or we don&#8217;t know yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> It&#8217;s a pretty big feature, the whole zoom out thing. So it&#8217;s one of those things that probably will need another iteration before they land in core, that will be&#8230; I think this way, this is the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I feel that too, but we&#8217;ll see. Because you can&#8217;t scale it down to say, okay, I have a minimum viable product and then iterate on it. If it disrupts your workflow too much, you can&#8217;t go back and then you have some backwards compatibility of something that you didn&#8217;t want. Being on the conscious side is definitely something that we learned with the whole Gutenberg releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> As you said, it works better with some other features that are just small steps so that the iterations happen in small steps and they&#8217;re not disturbing the actual workflow that people are already using. So this would be one of those things that if you put it in, things would change immediately for people and they have no chance to look into it or get used to it. Probably not even deactivated if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, and there&#8217;s also the surprise factor will not as intuitive as you want it to be. Sometimes you get some new feature and said, oh, that is cool. It triggers and you say, oh, that&#8217;s new and I like it. Most of the time it&#8217;s kind of, oh, what happened? Did I do something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> This disrupts my workflow. So that&#8217;s always the not so good option you want to I go for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So true. So true, yes. Then we come to one of the biggest features landed in Gutenberg 19.1 that a lot of people have been waiting for since Block Themes came out in Twenty Twenty Two. No, in Twenty Twenty. We first talked about block themes and I know because I had the early Carolina Nymark and Anders Noren and even a developer on the Gutenberg Live Q&amp;A.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">API<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the feature is how plugin can create templates that are edible in the site editor and API has landed right now with 19.1 in Gutenberg and almost immediately, well Justin Tadlock was working with a release candidate and he published a tutorial on how plugin developers can work with it or start at least experimenting with it on the developer block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s called Registering Block Templates via our plugins in WordPress 6.7, and it&#8217;s definitely worth getting to know that feature now because now it can be issues, bug reports can be found out, so definitely get into it when you&#8217;re interested in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has an example on where you do custom post types and custom fields for a book custom post type and then shows how to create the single book and then the archive book template and as well as the custom templates that you can offer for changing the single post book or something like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there will also be, on September 10th 15:00 UTC, that&#8217;s 9:00 AM Eastern and 17:00 European Central.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> It will be 11 Eastern?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 11 Eastern, yes. I make that mistake. All the time zones, the pain of my existence. So 11 Eastern, 8:00 AM Pacific, and 5:00 PM in Central Europe. There&#8217;s a developer hangout, a first look at the template registration API. You can RSVP wire the WordPress online meetup group and if you get the chance to look at the tutorial, you can also bring your questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like that combination of, okay, there&#8217;s an API in Gutenberg, we have a developer block post about it on how to use it and then we offer developer hours to it. So that&#8217;s a great way to roll out a feature that a lot of people have waited for and to integrate it into their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> It&#8217;s a full package and I definitely need to look into it because that&#8217;s very interesting, especially if you&#8217;re registering custom post types in some sort. And then imagine you have whatever plugin you&#8217;re using, if you&#8217;re using a plugin to register post types and then the plugin is able to provide you with a template or various templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you have specific templates, you can already tie that template to the post type when you register them, you can just go into the editor, no other files included, no chat theme where you need to throw in any other template, template files essentially and just start editing from there. I think that&#8217;s a pretty nice feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s a pretty feature, yeah, it&#8217;s something that hasn&#8217;t been done in WordPress before and it was not so easy for plugin developers to get it right in the first place, even with classic themes. So this is definitely a move forward and could entice some of the plugin developers that haven&#8217;t been migrating to the block editor yet entirely to rethink that piece because it&#8217;s probably easier to do it now without having to create custom blocks or anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read through the tutorial, it seems to be pretty straightforward and especially when you are already familiar with block themes and patterns and all that. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely on my to-do list for next week to check that out because that&#8217;s a really interesting thing. Also for other grade to provide additional templates for whatever you needed, have custom ideas, so that&#8217;s actually pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe even just blank templates registering, so let&#8217;s say you add a post type and then have a checkbox somewhere that says add templates to site editor and then you check the box, save it, and then go directly to the site editor and have an empty template there without having to go through this template creation process within the site editor. It just takes away a couple steps, but it makes it so smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Then creation for the post types. So that would be pretty gassed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And you probably could even find out what&#8217;s the overall header and footer and so you don&#8217;t have an empty template, you just have a template with the rest of the site already filled in. Might be something to think about. Yeah, so that&#8217;s the big, new feature right now it&#8217;s the first iteration of the API, so any feedback would be absolutely helpful if there are bug reports, put them in the GitHub issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to discuss it with other people, go to the developer hours and discuss it and then we&#8217;ll figure out or they figure out if there are some additional iterations necessary or feature requests. Also join us in the outreach channel to discuss some of the things. Moving on on the 19.1, do we have more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I think that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Don&#8217;t see anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. I had one thing in the documentation part because&#8230; Right. The interactivity API has additional documentation and it&#8217;s more on the basis of fundamentals. So it explains three core concept of the interactivity API in more depth, so people who had problems to figure out what the interactivity API is for and how it&#8217;s actually works can consult the new pages in the documentation and hopefully, get more clarity on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. So thank you so much, Jessica for going with me through the two changelogs for two plugins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have one more thing and that is what it&#8217;s an active development and that touches on the collaboration effort on WordPress, so more people can comment in line on the block editor about content and I share the issue with that. That&#8217;s issue 59445, 59445 if you want to grab it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course. The link is in the show notes, but the issue was just updated with some mock-ups on how this is supposed to work. There&#8217;s also a PR 60622 that you can definitely put into your playground and experiment with it, but the mock-ups are really nice. You can have in line comments per block and then see also in the site bar, it&#8217;s an overlay to the side bar who has with the comments for that particular block. That&#8217;s neat. Check it out. If you want to test the PR, it&#8217;s not merged yet. You would need to use the playground and punch in the number six, oh&#8230; What was it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Somewhere in the middle. Six, oh something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 60622, and then I&#8217;ll share the link in the show notes directly to the playground, the space where you can with the PR installed so you can test it. But it&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;m really excited about because when you&#8217;re working on a&#8230; You can take away the Google Docs commenting thing and not just edit or write directly in the block editor and have additional people comment on it. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely an interesting thing too. I would be interested if it&#8217;s actually possible that two people can already see a block post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s part of it. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I guess so. It would make sense. You can do it asynchronously, but I think doing it, seeing someone just like in a Google Docs, seeing someone editing stuff and then you can comment on it. I think that&#8217;s in a very interesting way forward to work with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The core contributors are working on so many things and just this section, our podcast almost points out some of the things that would be interesting to get an early view on it to get feedback on it or even figure out if that fits in your workflow for concentration or even in development.

In WordPress 6.7, plugin developers now can register block templates directly through their plugins. This simplifies the site-building process for users by giving them ready-made layouts and configurations.

Now, I know this may be a bit premature, but I wanted to share one element of what&#8217;s going on here with Do the Woo, coming in the new year, and that is contributor support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent Dev Chat, I joined the conversation around supporting contributors in the space. Towards the end of the conversation, I let a bit of the cat out of the bag regarding what we are doing with Do the Woo with our next big version in March 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what I revealed: I can’t really give away a lot of details at this point, as I’m still working them out. But moving into the next phase of Do the Woo, we are looking at a bigger investment in the community. The podcast has been one way to support the community. Other behind-the-scenes activities also play a part in this through conversations and connections. But another piece of Do the Woo will be focused on helping to sustain contributions in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a challenge. I think one of the things that I’ve learned as I’ve listened to a lot of guests and had conversations with many different people is that the funds are there. In the podcast, I talked about how Carl mentioned companies have it, and I work with a lot of different sponsors, or I speak to potential sponsors or new people coming into the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a number of sponsors here, and many of these new companies entering the ecosystem want to put their dollars to the best use to fit their own goals, but they don’t know where to start. They want to support the community, and they’re still trying to understand the ecosystem. As a result, I think there’s a chance to build a different mindset here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this means for Do the Woo is that we’ll be more of a conduit for some of these funds and companies who want to support the work of contributors. On top of that, Do the Woo will be putting money back in starting next year, and we’ll have it set to a pretty high standard through our sponsors, aiming to fill all the sponsor slots. At the same time, we will be supporting others who are making similar efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not reinventing the wheel. I think it’s going to be an educational process, and it may evolve on our side as we progress over the next few months. However, I’m hopeful that, however this plays out, we can open some eyes and maybe show that there are ways to do this. Sometimes, some companies need a bit of a push or guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation we had in the episode was a great start here at Do the Woo, and I think there’s a lot more to be said. I’m pretty excited about what we’re going to be doing, and I’m also excited about the direction the overall community is moving in, with both contributor support and, of course, elevating diversity as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just a short Do the Woo update. I wanted to give you a little heads-up. I know there are a lot of details that still need to be worked out, and I’m sure you’re going to hear it from not just us, but others in the space. I’d like to thank our pod friends again at OS Training. Make sure to check them out at ostraining.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a sponsor partner here at Do the Woo and helping the community in 2023, go to dothewoo.io/partnership. This is a pretty serious commitment for companies out there. It’s a year-long commitment, but if you’re interested, definitely let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s it for today, and until next time, keep on doing the Woo.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: in this ever evolving ecosystem, here at Do the Woo continues to support the community but also is supporting our hosts who tirelessly volunteer their time here at Do the Woo. You can now support individual shows that in turn support the hosts. The hosts can use the funds for their own travel and contribution time, or donate them to their choice in the community.</em> (Updated March 2023).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of Woo Bits, part of the Do the Woo podcast, the host discusses the upcoming release of Do The Woo 4.0, tentatively scheduled for March 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new version will focus on supporting contributors in the WooCommerce community. The host reveals plans for a larger investment into the community, with the aim of sustaining contributions.

It addresses a long-standing issue developers have faced with conflicts between plugins and themes, particularly when dealing with custom post types, taxonomies, or virtual pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new feature allows developers to register block templates directly within their plugins, providing fully customizable default content layouts.

I&#8217;m Karim Marucchi, your host from the Scale Consortium, and today we&#8217;re going to have a great episode talking specifically about how enterprise stakeholders and the customers we work with have been navigating the challenges of comparing monolithic CMS products with WordPress and open source CMSs and DXPs. Today, we have a very special guest with us, Dan Drapeau. Dan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Hey, Karim. I&#8217;m Dan Drapeau. I&#8217;m an independent consultant specializing in DXP advisory services. I&#8217;ve worked extensively with a wide array of digital experience platforms, content, and commerce platforms, starting from an engineering and architecture perspective and then evolving into platform strategy advisory. As the industry has shifted, I&#8217;ve expanded my expertise to include CDPs and personalization. In late 2023, I launched my brand, DXP Catalyst Consulting, to help guide organizations through their digital transformation journeys. I&#8217;ve been working in the CMS/DXP space for about 12 years, starting at NorthPoint Digital, then moving to EY for several years, and later taking on a tech director role at Blue Fountain Media in New York before landing at Vynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Okay, well, that&#8217;s quite a background in helping enterprises figure out what to use, so we&#8217;re going to tap into that. In your experience, how are they approaching procurement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Sometimes, let&#8217;s say the sponsor might be a CIO or CMO, they might suggest, &#8220;Hey, we need to do a DXP evaluation. This is the vendor I&#8217;ve worked with in the past, so I have a preference for this one.&#8221; It&#8217;s a challenging task for procurement to start from there. They can pull up a Gartner or Forrester document and look at the leading DXPs, but that doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story. Of course, there are open source solutions, and you can&#8217;t really compare an open source solution—or really, let&#8217;s talk about an open source CMS—to a DXP, right? It&#8217;s comparing apples and oranges. So that&#8217;s where procurement faces challenges initially, just trying to move forward with this type of conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />In my experience as well, you&#8217;re right. The stakeholder usually comes to the conversation already thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;ve either worked with Product X before or I want to work with Product Y going forward.&#8221; So they&#8217;re coming with these preconceptions. Are they asking procurement for alternatives, or are they bringing a set of alternatives? How is that working? Are procurement departments aware of what alternatives exist?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />I&#8217;m not sure if procurement departments are always in the know. I think there could be a variety of factors. It could be a CIO leading the charge to select a new enterprise solution for the company, and they might already be working with an outside agency and getting counsel on this. But yes, it’s certainly possible. In many circumstances, they come in saying, &#8220;We want to go with Adobe,&#8221; and then it&#8217;s up to procurement to find a couple of other selections if the company is truly trying to go at this alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Are you finding, in working with your customers, that sometimes these stakeholders ask RFP writers or proposal writers in their departments or even consultants to write it for a specific platform, as in &#8220;I just want to work with this platform,&#8221; or are they more open-ended? Before we even get to procurement, how are they approaching procurement when they do this? Are they approaching it with an open mind mostly, or do you see that most of the time they’ve already decided, &#8220;Let’s write it in this way&#8221;?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />It’s a mix. Sometimes I’ve seen outside agencies or consultancies write an RFP or RFI on behalf of the customer, and it might be tilted toward a particular vendor. I think if an organization is doing this alone, there tends to be more of an open mind in terms of writing the RFI, so it doesn’t benefit a single vendor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />That aligns with my experience as well, where you can sometimes tell if it’s been done with the help of an outside agent, as opposed to if they’ve hired someone like yourself who is independently thinking, &#8220;Let’s go talk about what your gap is.&#8221; Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />And oftentimes, the RFI might not come out that well if a company doesn’t have the experience to put these types of documents together, especially in the DXP/CMS world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Right, exactly. So now let’s turn to the scenario where they have written this RFI or RFP, and it’s geared toward wanting an all-in-one solution—a procurement solution that is one vendor. What are the challenges for procurement? How would procurement deal with that if suddenly someone says, &#8220;What about open source?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />I think they need to look more at the bigger picture here and really understand the requirements. Is a full DXP truly needed, where we’re talking about content management, analytics, personalization, email marketing, or do they really just need a CMS? Once you have a better grasp of the requirements, it’s easier to make comparisons. By having that full understanding, you can slice and dice things a little bit. So maybe you look at a couple of monolithic DXPs, but you could also consider individual CMS solutions or individual personalization solutions. It really depends on what’s in scope. I think that is pretty critical, and they also need to look at total cost of ownership. That’s a significant factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Of course, but I heard you say that if they’re looking at DXP or open source, there’s the same assumption that we’re dealing with in the open source world where they’re thinking it’s either DXP (meaning one system) or it’s open source. Now, in a lot of the marketing I’m seeing these days, the monolithic DXPs are bending over backward to try and use the word &#8220;composable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />So while they’re doing that, is that an opportunity for open source vendors to say, &#8220;Okay, let’s help you redefine DXP&#8221;? Instead of approaching it as an either/or, can they say, &#8220;No, this is the same as the monolithic; they’re just as composable&#8221;? How can the vendors approach that mindset of &#8220;It’s either DXP or I’m going to look into open source&#8221;?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />The rise of composability has changed things a little. Like you said, you’ve seen some of the vendors offer more of a composable suite now, transitioning from a monolith. And again, when I look at a DXP, it’s like an ecosystem of technologies or capabilities—content management, commerce, and so on. There’s no reason there can’t be an open source composable DXP, right? There could be an open source CMS at the heart of it, but then you could integrate any other product that you might want. So I think that’s a good way to view it when you’re trying to make a selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Right. So you mentioned being able to choose your own, and when the all-in-one vendors are trying to market the fact that they are all-in-one, saying &#8220;You don’t need to worry about it, even if it is composable, we’ve got your back,&#8221; I remember from our conversations that when you start your process, you conduct a MarTech gap analysis, right? Tell us about that and how it could help stakeholders and folks within an organization figure out if they need to be on the track for a monolithic system or if they could think composable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Sure. Oftentimes, I do the gap analysis when I’m working with marketing executives. Let’s say they’re defining a new digital customer experience and working with an agency on persona definition, journey mapping, UI/UX work to envision what it could look like. But when it comes to reality and actually trying to build a solution, there might be gaps in their MarTech ecosystem, and that’s where my service typically comes in. They might have a really old monolithic solution in place for a DXP, but there might be a scenario where they have an old CMS, but they’re missing capabilities for personalization, CDP, and other things they might need. That’s generally where I help. The output is typically either a platform strategy or optimizing their current architecture. If it’s a platform strategy, it’s important to understand where the gaps are and what capabilities we really need to look at because sometimes it’s not just CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Correct. Right. So if they’re looking at a DXP rather than just content management, it’s really about system integration. How would you approach that in helping the stakeholder say to their procurement department, &#8220;I’d like to look outside of a monolithic&#8221;? Do you have advice for open source vendors on how they can help their customers talk to procurement about looking beyond the monolithics?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />One thing I mentioned was really understanding the requirements. Again, do they need a DXP with a broad set of integrated capabilities, or do they need just a CMS or a best-of-breed solution? I think educating the client stakeholders is pretty important—making sure they understand the benefits and trade-offs of open source solutions and what composable architecture means, why taking a composable modular approach makes sense. Composable doesn’t only mean SaaS solutions; you obviously have to factor in open source here. Educating them on not just the total cost of ownership but also the flexibility you get is crucial. Case studies can be helpful in showing the value of open source and why they should consider it. Sometimes proposing a pilot or proof of concept can go a long way as well, but I don’t see that used too often anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />So that can help our customer stakeholders explain it to others within their departments, whether it’s marketing or IT, and so forth. But when they</p>\n\n\n\n<p>switch and say, &#8220;Right, I’m going to think of going to these two monolithic systems and a third option, I’d like to look at open source,&#8221; what our listeners would love to know is how they can tell procurement that this is worth doing. This is worth not only looking at monolithics where you’re going to talk to one vendor, but also at open source where you might have to talk to multiple vendors. I think you nailed it earlier when you mentioned total cost of ownership, but what other benefits or information do they need to give procurement? From what I’ve seen—and you tell me, you’re the expert—procurement is focused on schedule, ease of contract, and costs. So how do we get that information to procurement? How can our listeners approach their procurement professionals and help them understand why they should go through the extra effort?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Well, I think there can be some trade-offs when you’re looking at the monolithic solutions as well, such as vendor lock-in, which is a significant one. You just have so much more flexibility with open source solutions, and that’s a pretty important thing for the stakeholders to actually understand. And again, TCO is incredibly significant in justifying why an open source solution should be evaluated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Okay, great. Have you run into any examples where they’ve been looking at solutions and had questions about how many vendors it takes or what the difference is between dealing with a monolithic and an open source platform?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Yeah, that topic comes up. There’s a lot to delve into when looking at the advantages and disadvantages of a monolithic DXP versus open source. I’m happy to dive into that if it makes sense here. So where to start? It’s one of my favorite conversations. I think one significant disadvantage of a monolithic solution is innovation lag. Monolithic solutions just don’t keep pace with rapid changes in the digital landscape. New features and capabilities take a long time to develop and release, which limits what the organization can do. I know we’re talking mostly about content management, but one example I like using is around commerce. If you’re a retailer and you’ve got a monolithic commerce solution, let’s say there’s a rise in voice commerce, augmented reality commerce, or conversational commerce. With that type of solution, how can you really compete in the market when your competitors might have a more modern architecture or solution and can adapt to trends and technologies more quickly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a monolithic solution, there tends to be complex implementation, and upgrading is a huge undertaking. For example, with Sitecore, upgrading from version 8 to 9 or 9 to 10 is a big project. You don’t typically have that issue with open source solutions, with one caveat: older versions of Drupal. There tend to be high initial costs upfront with monolithic DXPs and just a lot of lack of flexibility. You’ve got vendor lock-in; it’s tough to switch providers. If you’re using a solution with built-in personalization, it may not be easy to leverage another personalization solution or vendor. You have a pre-integrated package, and scalability can be an issue with monolithic DXPs as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Let me back you up a second. When you mentioned the lack of innovation, that’s why they started switching their conversations from &#8220;We are monolithic&#8221; to &#8220;We’re really composable; you can plug things in and out,&#8221; and they start touting the fact that they have APIs. Are they exposing their entire system so you can plug into any part of it and use any other system? Because that’s how the marketing makes it sound. How extensive are these APIs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />It depends. There are still some monolithic solutions in the market. I mentioned Sitecore quite a bit because I’ve worked with it extensively, especially at Vynamic. They’ve got their XP product, which is a truly monolithic solution where you’ve got content management, personalization, email marketing, and analytics all bundled together. They’ve transitioned to a composable suite where they offer a number of other SaaS products that you can integrate. But there are trade-offs with that too, like having to deal with multiple interfaces. Some companies have shifted in that direction, but their customers haven’t, and their customers might still be using the monolithic solutions today because it’s a big investment to go from a single all-in-one solution to potentially needing to license four or five tools from the same vendor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />That can actually bring your cost of ownership higher and higher each time they &#8220;innovate.&#8221; So if it’s harder to innovate, that’s the negative. On the positive side, you do have one throat to choke on the vendor side. You have one way to handle things. Today, with Acquia, you can use Drupal and still have a one-vendor solution by bringing in one of their approved agencies and the way they’re structuring their projects these days. But besides that one example, if you do want to use WordPress and DXP-style functions, how do you decide where to go? How do you approach that conversation when you’re speaking to your customers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Really understanding what capabilities they need and then exploring independent or best-of-breed solutions in each of those areas. DXP encompasses a lot, from content management through commerce, CDP, personalization, DAM, and more. There are many vendors with great solutions in each of those areas that are not part of a broader vendor-specific DXP. Once you understand what you’ve got with WordPress, but know you need a CDP and personalization capabilities, you can focus your search on what other solutions are out there and figure out how to integrate them within your solution, like WordPress. It’s easier in some cases, like with Drupal where Acquia exists, and they do have a number of products in their ecosystem, so it’s one throat to choke, right? It’s a single vendor. With WordPress, you have more flexibility and infinite choices to figure out what the right solution might be. You just have to do more exploration on your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />So the negative being that you have to do a little bit more homework or come a little more prepared. But what I’m hearing is that there’s an opportunity for both open source vendors and for the customers within an enterprise organization, the stakeholders, to say, &#8220;I have some ideas about how I want to do things, and if I understand the major pieces I want to put together, then a good consultant or agency can help me fill in those gaps if I find the right one.&#8221; There’s an opportunity there, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />For sure. I think in most cases, I would recommend that an organization go with an agency or independent consultant because it’s hard to do this on your own. Most companies don’t have the inside knowledge about every CDP vendor out there or what the right solutions are and how they all integrate. That’s a hard problem to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Right. So Dan, we’ve talked about how to approach the stakeholders and how the stakeholders might want to approach procurement to talk about some of these things. Do you have any advice for agencies or WordPress hosting platforms on the best ways to show a procurement department that they can create the same type of solution as some of these monolithics? How can they compete?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Sure. I think it’s up to the agency and maybe the enterprise hosting provider to come in as a united front. In my experience, having these discussions with procurement departments, that has worked most effectively. So at least within the WordPress space, when we’re talking about enterprise hosting, typically you think of WP Engine, Automattic’s WordPress VIP, and Pantheon as great options. So, coming in as a united force is really the key approach I would take in that circumstance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />That makes sense. I’ve seen a lot of RFPs come across where they are specifically written for monolithic systems. Do you have any advice for agencies or hosts when it comes to answering these questions, especially when the answers might actually be split across both vendor and host?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Yes, actually. Branching off our topic of working as a united front, I think it’s the same in this circumstance. If I were an agency, I would lean on the vendor, like WP Engine, to answer the questions specifically around infrastructure. Then, as the agency, I would answer the questions from more of a services or integration perspective and be transparent. It’s a collective effort; it’s not an all-in-one solution or product that does everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Okay, Dan, thank you. That’s a really good answer. So, in answering these questions and trying to help procurement understand how best to look at these options, it sounds like being yourself, being honest, and going out of your way to explain the benefits of open source—not only the total cost of ownership but also the deep expertise that you’re going to get from multiple vendors—is key. It sounds like the key here is to highlight composability and the fact that you’re not monolithic. I think that’s what I’m hearing in this conversation. Could you share some insights on how the different agencies or vendors around WordPress and open source can roadmap their services or approach to dealing with these types of customers? How can they compete? If you could give us a wrap-up of how they can prepare to have these conversations, what kind of homework should they do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />Yes, I think roadmapping is key. If an agency is coming in with a solution like WordPress for content management, having a roadmap for where you might need to inject new functionality, like personalization, might make sense down the road. How are you going to address that within WordPress? You might select a specific tool and plan out how the integration would work, and also factor in prerequisite work, like having a personalization strategy. A lot of that logic</p>\n\n\n\n<p>needs to be sorted out in advance because, from a monolithic vendor solution perspective, they can just say, &#8220;We flip a switch.&#8221; Obviously, that’s not really the reality, but that’s how they would probably go about presenting it. So, with agencies and hosting providers, it’s more about presenting a thorough roadmap and maybe even an architecture of the direction you’re going to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Okay, so I asked from the point of view of an agency, but really that’s also what the buyer should keep in mind. At the end of the day, you do have the negatives of &#8220;It’s the Wild West; it’s very open; you have the entire MarTech 11,000+ that you could compose a solution from.&#8221; But the positives are that if you find the right partner, if you find the right consultant, such as yourself, to help with figuring out what your needs are and then find the right agency and the right platform, you can have solutions that don’t need to be re-platformed every three to five years. They can just develop because you are truly composable, and as you want to move from personalization X to Y or email platform W to Z, you can do that because you are truly composable when using open source as a hub. Is that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan:<br />For sure. Yes. I think with most monolithic solutions, one thing we touched on was the significant upgrades, and it’s really the case if they’re cloud-hosted. But that is a major problem, and you don’t have that flexibility to test out a new vendor or product very easily without an extensive amount of work. With open source and a composable framework, it’s a totally different story. With WordPress, you never have significant upgrade cycles, right? There are incremental updates, and I think normally the enterprise hosting provider handles those core updates for you, and you’re more on the hook for updating plugins and things like that. But the major pro is that you don’t have to deal with significant upgrade cycles. You can focus more on innovation and building out new functionality. That’s the key, most critical part for the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Great. Thank you. With that, I’d like to thank everybody for joining us and look forward to our next conversation. Please don’t forget to visit our page and get our podcast from wherever you get your favorite podcasts. This has been Scaling Enterprise WordPress and Open Source Software. I&#8217;m Karim Marucchi, and thank you for joining us.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Scaling Enterprise WordPress and Open Source, The Buyer&#8217;s View</em></strong>, host <strong>Karim Marucchi</strong> is joined by <strong>digital experience platform (DXP) expert Dan Drapeau</strong> to explore the challenges and strategies involved in selecting the right CMS and DXP solutions for enterprise organizations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They dive into the complexities of procurement, the rise of composable architectures, and the benefits and trade-offs of monolithic versus open source platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re navigating vendor lock-in, conducting a MarTech gap analysis, or considering the total cost of ownership, this episode offers valuable insights for making informed decisions in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Procurement Challenges</strong>: Enterprise stakeholders often approach procurement with preconceived preferences for specific platforms, making it challenging for procurement teams to evaluate all viable options, especially when considering open source solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monolithic vs. Composable Solutions</strong>: Monolithic Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) can lead to vendor lock-in and slow innovation. Composable architectures, including open source solutions, offer greater flexibility and adaptability to rapidly changing market trends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</strong>: While monolithic solutions may appear more integrated, the total cost of ownership, including long-term flexibility, innovation, and upgrade cycles, often makes open source and composable solutions more attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Education and Communication</strong>: It&#8217;s crucial for stakeholders to educate their procurement teams on the benefits of open source and composable solutions. This includes understanding composable architectures, the flexibility of open source, and the long-term advantages over monolithic systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Role of Agencies and Consultants</strong>: Independent consultants and agencies play a critical role in helping organizations navigate the complexities of selecting and integrating the right DXP and CMS solutions. Partnering with knowledgeable experts can make the process smoother and more effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Innovation and Upgrade Cycles</strong>: Monolithic solutions often lag in innovation and require significant effort to upgrade, while open source solutions allow for incremental updates and continuous innovation without disruptive upgrade cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strategic Roadmapping</strong>: Agencies and vendors should focus on presenting clear roadmaps that outline how to integrate new functionalities within a composable framework. This helps in communicating the long-term benefits and flexibility of open source solutions to procurement and stakeholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Links to learn more or that were mentioned</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-drapeau/\">Dan on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dxpcatalyst.com/\">DXP Catalyst Consulting</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/\"><strong>Acquia</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpvip.com/\">Automattic WordPress VIP</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.sitecore.com/\">Sitecore</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cxtoday.com/loyalty-management/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-digital-experience-platforms-dxps-2024/\">Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) 2024</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 09:09:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Matt: People Wanted\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=124251\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"https://ma.tt/2024/08/people-wanted/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1334:\"<p>There&#8217;s an <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/shackleton-probably-never-took-out-an-ad-seeking-men-for-a-hazardous-journey-5552379/\">apocryphal</a> story about Ernest Shackleton putting an ad in the newspaper that read:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Men wanted for hazardous journey.

The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, ADHD, focus and working in tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Chris Ferdinandi. Chris, a web developer with ADHD, has navigated both the human resources and web development landscapes. He&#8217;s here to share his unique experiences and insights on how ADHD has shaped his career and daily life, as well as offer practical strategies for managing ADHD in the workplace and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the world of ADHD, exploring the challenges and advantages it brings, especially in a world designed for neuro-typical individuals. Chris talks about the abundance of ideas, risk-taking behaviour, and the lack of impulse control that can present both opportunities and obstacles. He candidly discusses how ADHD affects his ability to focus, regulate attention, and how it impacts emotions and impulse control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris refers to ADHD traits as superpowers, and embraces them whilst also acknowledging the real world difficulties. He discusses how ADHD individuals often struggle with hyper focus, and how interruptions can be particularly detrimental to their workflows. He suggests structuring workdays with blocked off meeting times to maintain focus upon tasks which need doing in the timescales required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also touch upon other workplace accommodations, the importance of understanding ADHD subtypes, and navigating disclosure in professional settings. Chris emphasises the strengths that come with ADHD, and offers practical tips like starting small tasks, trying to regulate dopamine and taking breaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, Chris invites listeners to engage with him and explore more resources on his website, which is linked to in the show notes, which you can find at wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how ADHD can turn challenges into career strengths, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Chris Ferdinandi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Chris Ferdinandi. Hi Chris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Hey Nathan. Thanks so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are very, very welcome. Chris is on the podcast today, we just had a little chat actually about how we connected, and that&#8217;s a story in itself. We were going to do a different podcast episode, but we&#8217;ve ended up doing this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story today is going to be all about ADHD. I explained to Chris that I know what the acronym means, we&#8217;ll have question marks about the acronym&#8217;s appropriateness as well. But I actually don&#8217;t know how it applies to people&#8217;s lives. My knowledge of medicine and all of that is pretty poor in all honesty. So there&#8217;s a nice conversation to be had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin that conversation, Chris, I&#8217;m just wondering if you could just set out the stall, give us your two minute bio, who you are, what your relationship is with web development, and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m a web developer, I have ADHD. I originally started off my life as a human resource professional, sometimes called personnel, depending on where you&#8217;re at. And I had a WordPress blog because I had really strong opinions on how HR worked, and what I liked about it, and what I didn&#8217;t, and I wanted to have a little bit more control over look and feel of that. So I taught myself web development, and eventually loved it so much that I made it my job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress literally kickstarted my career. But early in my career, I felt like I couldn&#8217;t get anything done. I was pretty sure I was going to get fired from my first job, and that kind of sent me down this whole rabbit hole of exploration, and learning about productivity and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But since then, I&#8217;ve discovered a bunch of systems and strategies that work for me, that let me turn my ADHD into a superpower. One of the things I learned is that a lot of productivity advice for neurotypical folks just does not work for ADHD people. And yeah, so I&#8217;m here today talk about the joys and struggles of being a developer with ADHD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, it&#8217;s really interesting. I&#8217;m really pleased that you are willing to talk to me about this, and I do apologise if I put my foot in my mouth at any point. But we&#8217;ll try to get through it, and hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to educate me as the podcast episode goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My understanding of ADHD, as I said, is incredibly narrow. I really only know what the acronym is, and the broadest brush strokes of what that might mean. We use the term in the UK ADHD, that acronym, but I&#8217;ve also heard people say ADD. Do you just want to outline what the acronym stands for? And just flesh out a little bit how it applies to your life, and what it means for you, and how you might be different from somebody without ADHD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:42] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Absolutely. ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ADD stands for Attention Deficit Disorder. They used to be, like I think around the eighties, nineties, they were considered two different things. These days, in most medical literature, it is all ADHD, and then there&#8217;s a few different subtypes. One of them is inattentive, which is what you would normally think of as ADD. The other one is hyperactive, which is what I think most people think of as ADHD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those, the name is actually bad. And I don&#8217;t mean like bad, like you shouldn&#8217;t use it, it&#8217;s like a bad descriptor of what ADHD actually is. Because people with ADHD don&#8217;t have a deficit of attention as the name describes. That&#8217;s what it seemed like when it was first identified and labeled, but it&#8217;s actually an executive functioning disorder. And so more typically what you find is folks with ADHD have trouble regulating their attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We almost have too much of it, not a deficit, and sometimes it&#8217;s scattered in a million different directions. Other times it is hyper-focused on just one thing, to the detriment of all the other things around us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ADHD can manifest in a whole bunch of fun ways. One of them is that you have trouble kind of focusing on the one thing you&#8217;re supposed to be doing, either because you&#8217;re thinking about a million other things, or you&#8217;re thinking about the one thing that has really locked in your attention at that particular moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, if you have the kind of the hyperactive or impulsive subtype, you have an excess energy, so you might hear things like, oh, you&#8217;re a lot. In social situations, people might find you overwhelming, for lack of a better word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has a whole bunch of other seemingly unrelated side effects, that are all related to the way, biologically, an ADHD brain is different from a neurotypical brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my brain does not produce as much dopamine as a typical person&#8217;s might. That&#8217;s where the difficulty regulating my attention comes from. But it also has some other interesting side effects, like dopamine is related to your ability to perceive time. So a lot of folks with ADHD suffer from something called time blindness, where you literally do not perceive time as it accurately occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that whole like, time flies when you&#8217;re having a good time kind of thing, that is an ever present state for someone with ADHD. If you&#8217;re having fun, time goes really fast. If you&#8217;re not, it goes painfully slow. There is no like regular passage of time. And if you ask me how long something took, or how long something will take, I literally cannot tell you because I cannot accurately perceive time. So that&#8217;s really fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also common with ADHD is a difficulty sometimes regulating your emotions. So mild slights, or just like really minor things can feel very big, or you can have emotional responses to things that are outsised for the actual size of the thing that has happened to you. So minor setbacks can feel really big. A slight comment on a performance review can feel like a really big emotional dagger. You know, that can make certain work situations really difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other, I think, big kind of hallmark for folks with ADHD is a lack of impulse control. There&#8217;s a tendency to just say whatever&#8217;s on your mind without having that filter first, that stops you from saying, hey, should I say this? Or you&#8217;ll get an impulse to do something, and you&#8217;ll just go for it without pausing to assess risk, or think through, if I do this, that will happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these things are both blessings and curses, depending on kind of the situation and how you apply them. And so a big part of what I do professionally now is try to help other ADHD folks understand how to reduce the negative impacts of some of these things, and also pivot some of these things into benefits. It&#8217;s like that whole thing where like, every strength a person has can also be a weakness if applied poorly, and vice versa. So yeah, I help folks channel some of these things that challenge them, into things that can really help them in their career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned there that you obviously have this, but it sounded like you categorised it into two different variants. There was, I can&#8217;t remember the exact wording, but you said that there was two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:35] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> So there&#8217;s technically three subtypes. The first is inattentive, which is what most folks think of as, historically as ADD, where you have trouble regulating your attention, but you don&#8217;t have the hyperactivity. There&#8217;s hyperactive or impulsive, where you tend to have bad impulse control and a lot of energy, but you&#8217;re not necessarily inattentive. You don&#8217;t have trouble regulating your attention, you just can&#8217;t control your impulses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the most commonly diagnosed type, which is combined, where you have both. And that&#8217;s what, historically, was just called ADHD. The thing with the inattentive subtype, so hyperactive or impulsive by itself is relatively uncommon, the inattentive subtype is less commonly diagnosed, but I am increasingly of the belief that it&#8217;s not actually less common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m hearing of a lot of people who are diagnosed with that subtype as an adult. And one of the theories is that, because it doesn&#8217;t come with the hyperactivity as well, it&#8217;s harder to recognise in people and diagnose, especially when they&#8217;re children. Historically, it&#8217;s been described as more common in women, but I am also learning of a lot of adult males who are being diagnosed with the inattentive subtype.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a theory that it&#8217;s just, because you don&#8217;t have that like hyperactivity that makes it like a little bit more obvious that you are not like everyone else, it&#8217;s potentially less commonly diagnosed. To the outside it can appear like the person is just lazy, or not trying hard enough, when really there&#8217;s a lot more going on under the hood other than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I want to keep going down this exploration route of what ADHD is, if that&#8217;s all right? And there&#8217;s a couple of questions around this. The first one is, is it possible to sort of have episodes of ADHD? And what I mean by that is, is this a constant partner in your life? Are you always in this state, or do you have periods of time where it backs away a little bit, and then comes on a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> It&#8217;s a great question. So the answer is, yes, it&#8217;s ever present, but the degree to which it manifests, or the ways in which it affects my life are variable. So I will have days, weeks, months, where I feel very on, very productive, because remember the issue is not that I don&#8217;t have enough attention, it&#8217;s that I have trouble regulating it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there will be periods where my attention is highly regulated in directions that are professionally or personally beneficial. Really focused on a big coding project I have going on, or we&#8217;ve got some big project going around on the house and it&#8217;s all I can think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be other periods of time where I feel like my brain is in a million different directions. Sometimes in the ADHD community, folks will describe this as like I have bees in my head, because it literally just feels like you&#8217;ve got like a swarm of stuff bouncing all over the place, like a busy beehive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I will find myself hyperfocused on a thing that&#8217;s not the thing that&#8217;s most important for me to be thinking about right now. Just as an example, let&#8217;s say you were really excited about buying like an RV or a caravan, and if you&#8217;re a neurotypical person, that might be a thing you think about and you&#8217;re downtime, and you do some research nights and weekends, and you&#8217;re really excited about it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, me, as an ADHD person, I might spend the full eight hours of my working day just obsessing about this. And anytime I try to pivot to doing work, that&#8217;ll be the thing I keep coming back to. And I find myself Googling it, and watching YouTube videos, and digging into like caravan, van life, TikTok, and just not able to focus on the other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use that example because that&#8217;s a real thing that happened to me a couple of years ago, where I had a project, and then you end up in this really bad position where now you&#8217;re rushing to get a thing done last minute, and you don&#8217;t have as much time as you would have, if you had just focused on what you were supposed to, I guess is maybe the right phrase here. But it&#8217;s one of those things where your body literally will not let you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The caveat here is I am also currently not on ADHD medication. I am actively looking into getting some specifically because of stuff like this, because it can be a real hindrance to getting the things done in your life that you need to get done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I ask, when did you first have intuitions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:32] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Oh yeah, no, I was diagnosed as a kid. This was in the eighties when the only thing that they really had for treatment was Ritalin. And it was often over-prescribed because it was relatively new, and dosing was this mysterious dance. And they didn&#8217;t even really understand why it worked for folks with ADHD. My parents decided not to medicate me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, the primary thing was just like, oh, this person&#8217;s really hyper. That was like the main thing, and there wasn&#8217;t as much of an understanding around a lot of the other ways in which it impacts your life. There was also a lot of, both weird stigma, and also denial that it existed, because a lot of times it was predominantly prescribed in boys. There was a lot of folks who were like, oh, they&#8217;re just throwing this at any boy who shows a little bit of energy, and that&#8217;s just how boys are and, you know, just all the like gender stereotype kind of stuff around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s only been in the last five or six years I started digging back into ADHD, and discovered that a lot of things I thought were just weird personal quirks of mine, like responding overly emotionally to things that probably weren&#8217;t that big of a deal, or not having any idea how long, how much time had passed. It wasn&#8217;t until very recently that I realised, oh, these are ADHD things too, this is not just me. But yeah, so I was diagnosed as a kid, but never really treated for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. And it is a medical diagnosis, I&#8217;m guessing. It&#8217;s not something that you could ascribe to yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:51] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> So yes and no. It is a medical diagnosis, and if you ever wanted to explore getting medication for it, it does require an actual diagnosis from a physician. In the United States it requires a psychiatrist, those are psychologists who can actually write medical prescriptions. I know in the UK the process is a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a whole thing, but I have found from a lot of folks, because I know, I&#8217;ve heard from friends in your region of the world, that it can be kind of a lengthy process to get seen and get diagnosed. In the interim, there are self-assessments that you can do, and I actually have a link to those. If you head over to adhdftw.com/wp-tavern, I put together a whole bunch of resources around stuff we&#8217;re going to be talking about in this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of those is, do I have ADHD? It&#8217;s got a link to two self-assessments, one for people who identify as men, one for people who identify as women. The reason there are two different quizzes is because it often manifests differently in women, and the test for women accounts for that, and make some adjustments to the way it rates certain questions, just to get around that whole women are often underdiagnosed thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I mention this is, you can&#8217;t get medication with a self-diagnosis, but if you take the quiz and you learn that you might have ADHD, because it won&#8217;t say that you do, but it&#8217;s say that you might, right, strongly indicates that you might have it. That can at the very least give you some better understanding of who you are as a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like for me, learning all of these other things that I thought were just weird personality quirks were ADHD related, and then learning some tools and strategies that other folks with ADHD have implemented to work with them, made a huge difference for me, both in terms of my understanding of myself, my self-esteem, my ability to be productive and functional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it&#8217;s one of those, I would never tell someone you don&#8217;t need a medical diagnosis, but I would say that, as a first step, completing a self-diagnosis exam is a great way to kick off this journey if you think you might have ADHD. I can at least point you in the right direction and get you some information about yourself that might be helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is a peculiar question, and if it doesn&#8217;t land, I apologise. If I find myself infected with Covid, it&#8217;s all bad. I see that as a bad thing. I had days, and days, and days, months, and years without Covid, I got Covid. A period of time where I&#8217;m feeling bad. Do you have a relationship with your ADHD where any of it is viewed as positive in your head? Are there bits of it that you think, I&#8217;m actually kind of grateful that this is in my life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, for everything that we&#8217;ve talked about thus far, it&#8217;s easy to dwell on, it&#8217;s all negative. But there are aspects of what you described where, I suppose if you&#8217;ve got the right framing in your head, you might be able to forgive yourself, and for periods of time at least anyway, think, oh, that worked well for me. And again, I&#8217;m sorry if that landed wrong, but I hope you understand the tenor of the question, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:46] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> This honestly almost feels like a softball question for me, Nathan. You&#8217;re setting up the reason I&#8217;m here. I am exceedingly ADHD positive. As I mentioned, my parents did not treat my ADHD as a kid, but I didn&#8217;t have a lot of that, oh, you&#8217;re so lazy, you just need to apply yourself more. Like I didn&#8217;t get a lot of that negative self internalisation that some folks with ADHD often have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents very much encouraged me to just follow my whims, and explore my creative side. And so I firmly believe that, while ADHD absolutely creates some interesting personal challenges, they&#8217;re not inherently worse personal challenges than someone neurotypical might have, they&#8217;re just different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody has some things they&#8217;re really good at and some things that they absolutely suck at, and a whole bunch of stuff in between. And my set, as an ADHD person, just happens to be different than yours as a neurotypical person. And a lot of the challenges with having ADHD are not specifically related to the ADHD, but related to moving about in a world, in a work environment, that was designed around the preferences of neurotypical folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, I see. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:54] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> So, for example, I&#8217;m drowning in ideas, I have more ideas than I could ever use in a lifetime. They just come falling out of my head. Some of them are terrible ideas, but I have more ideas than I can explore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other aspects of the impulse control thing, right? So in certain contexts that can be a very bad thing, but folks with ADHD are also a lot more likely to take risks, not just in a negative way, but in a positive way. They&#8217;re a lot more likely to be entrepreneurial. They&#8217;re a lot more likely to pursue hard things because they don&#8217;t stop to think, oh, this could be really hard and it&#8217;s not going to work out for me. And what if this happens, and that happens, and that happens? They just go for it. Sometimes they fail, sometimes they don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of impulse control also means that I am often, usually the most honest person on any team that I&#8217;m working on. And in certain contexts that can mean that I put my foot in my mouth, but it also means that my managers, and my clients, and the people that I work with also know I&#8217;m the person that they can come to when they want a genuine and honest reaction to something, and not just like a yes man, bs kind of, oh yeah, that sounds great kind of response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I wrote an article recently about the whole, if ADHD folks talk to neurotypical folks the way neurotypical folks sometimes talk about ADHD, and I&#8217;m not saying you did this Nathan, so please don&#8217;t take this personally. Like, we would say things like, oh, it&#8217;s so sad that you can&#8217;t just live in the moment, that you&#8217;re always like thinking about the future, and thinking about consequences for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you embrace it, there can be a real freeness that comes with ADHD. It absolutely can create challenges. And even if the world was structured around my preferences, and not neurotypical folks preferences, I still exist in a society with other humans, right? And like I do things that irritate the heck out of my partner and she&#8217;s neurotypical. But even if she wasn&#8217;t, I am certain some of my ADHD quirks would also irritate her. Because I have some students who are ADHD with ADHD partners, and their ADHDness sometimes gets on each other&#8217;s nerves too. So I&#8217;m not trying to say it&#8217;s all sunshine and roses, but every challenge that ADHD presents, there is a subsequent strength that you can tap into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think on the website you describe it as superpowers, which we&#8217;ll get into in a minute. But the analogy that&#8217;s coming into my head, and this may be terrible, but this is what I&#8217;m thinking of, so I believe that I don&#8217;t have ADHD, my attention and my energy levels can kind of be regulated in the same way that, if I go to a, we call it a tap, I think you call it a faucet. I can regulate that, I can turn it whichever way I like, whereas it feels to me, maybe yours is kind of more like really full on, or maybe switched off, it&#8217;s less granular. That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;m imagining it in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:33] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> That feels very accurate for me, yes. And the other thing too is like, so to belabour this analogy, if I turn on the tap and I don&#8217;t want to, it tends to be like a really old and corroded tap, you need to turn extra hard to get going, and it&#8217;ll start as just a little bit of a trickle, and you need to like really wrench it and then it turns into a torrent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to make it sound like, if you have stuff to do when you don&#8217;t want to do it, you can never do it, it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s substantially harder. And most folks with ADHD who function have learned tips and tricks that they use to get themselves doing things that they&#8217;re not particularly interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, I think that&#8217;s where we should go next. So you&#8217;ve obviously, throughout your life, you&#8217;ve encountered a variety of different problems, and perhaps it has been compounded by ADHD. And so the second part of this podcast, beginning now I guess, is to go through some of those. I can&#8217;t really ask questions around this because I don&#8217;t know what the things would be worth exploring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I&#8217;ll do is just say, tell us, just give us your wisdom, tell us some of the things that you&#8217;ve discovered over the years, and how they might fit into the work life of somebody that would be listening to this podcast. They&#8217;re probably at a desk, they&#8217;re probably on a computer, you know, they&#8217;re coding away, or they&#8217;re creating plugins, blocks, themes, those kind of things. And yeah, I&#8217;ll just unleash you and say, tell us what you&#8217;ve discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:50] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Yeah, so there&#8217;s a handful of things. The big thing with any sort of creative work, whether it&#8217;s coding, design, the arts of any sort is that, getting into a flow is really important. I think anybody who&#8217;s done deep coding work, or design work can recall that feeling, where you are really focused on the thing you&#8217;re doing and time seems to be zipping by, and you&#8217;re in a really productive state, you feel like all cylinders are hitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For ADHD folks, that tends to manifest as our hyper focus, where we are extremely fixated on that one thing. Getting into it can either be really easy, if it&#8217;s a thing you&#8217;re very passionate about, to the point that you literally, you cannot help yourself, or it can be really challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if it&#8217;s something you&#8217;re interested in, sometimes your body just doesn&#8217;t want to cooperate. I think the game, or the end goal, if you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s doing creative professional work as a person with ADHD, is to get into that hyper focus around meaningful work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re having a day where that just clicks, it&#8217;s awesome, but if you&#8217;re not, there are a few things that are acutely, well, there&#8217;s a few things you can do, but there&#8217;s also a few things that can really ruin that for you, even if you&#8217;re naturally in that state. For example, because ADHD brains have trouble regulating their attention, interruptions are much more costly and painful for us than they are for neurotypical folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of folks who have been in the flow before know that feeling of getting broken out of it, and how like frustrating they can feel, and how it can take a little bit to get back into it. Much worse for someone with ADHD. So like midday meetings, for example, open offices where someone can just randomly pop over to your desk. Those are really, really detrimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote an article over at ADHDftw/wptavern. But I wrote this article on what I call the temporal dead zone, which is this period where, you&#8217;ve just finished a task and you have a meeting that&#8217;s starting sometime in the next 30 to 60 minutes, a lot of ADHDers will just avoid starting any additional work before that meeting, because if they do and they get into a hyper focus, they&#8217;re going to get interrupted. And that&#8217;s either going to be really painful, or you&#8217;re going to forget entirely about the meeting, and you&#8217;re just going to not show up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the meeting ends, and then there&#8217;s this other lengthy period of you getting refocused into your work . And so like midday meetings can just completely ruin a day for someone with ADHD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to structure my days where I have meeting days and completely blocked out, please don&#8217;t book my time, kind of days, because it&#8217;s absolutely destructive. I will pause for a second, Nathan, just in case you have questions because I will ramble without stopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I do actually have a question there, and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily relate to that, but I do take the point that you&#8217;re making. You&#8217;re sort of portioning up your week a little bit so that you allow yourself to be, I don&#8217;t know, in a day where interruptions can happen, or in a day where you just, I cannot be interrupted and I know that that will work better for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there was something that you said there, which I just wrote down. I scribbled it down as you were saying it, you said, so you were talking about this 60 minute, or 30 minute window where you wouldn&#8217;t want to start something, and you said, because the interruption would be painful. And I wondered what you meant by that. And what I&#8217;m meaning is, I&#8217;m associating pain with an actual, physical harm. Does it manifest on that kind of level? Is it a almost like a pain, or is it just extreme discomfort? What did you mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:13] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a cognitive pain that, I&#8217;m trying to think of a good analogy here. The best way I can describe it is, if you&#8217;ve ever felt like an intense longing for something, or someone that you couldn&#8217;t have, it feels a lot like that. If I&#8217;m deeply focused on a thing, and then you rip me away from that thing, my brain will remain focused on that thing, frustrated that it can&#8217;t do anything with that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially if you couple that with challenges regulating your emotions, it can even, in certain contexts, cause like irritability, or like being short with people when you don&#8217;t mean to. Yeah, so it can be a real challenge, and a lot of ADHD folks will kind of avoid putting themselves in that position, they know what&#8217;s going to happen, right? Like you&#8217;ll just start to ramp up into the work, and then you&#8217;ll get ripped away from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;ve been deprived of something that you are absolutely keen to get on with. So for me, a task given to me by anybody, I could put it down, pick it up, put it down, pick it up, I&#8217;d probably feel, on some level, a little bit frustrated if I was in the zone, as I describe it to myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is a more intense feeling of longing, and then that longing gets broken, and so you feel deprived, and possibly a bit annoyed. Again, I&#8217;m not trying to put words in your mouth but, am I about in the right ballpark?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:30] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Yeah, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Gosh, that&#8217;s fascinating. Okay, so we&#8217;ve talked about the portioning up of the week. Was there anything else that you wanted to cover?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:38] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Yeah, so I talk about this concept of kind of following your ADHD flow, or working with your natural state a fair bit with some of the folks that I work with around this. And you&#8217;re going to have weeks, you&#8217;re going to have days where you&#8217;re a bit more like on than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you will have days where you&#8217;re just naturally, deeply focused and phenomenally productive. And then you&#8217;re going to have days where you&#8217;re not, getting yourself into the flow of work is a little bit harder than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve had fellow ADHDers, and I&#8217;ve also been guilty of this myself, describe these days where you sit in front of the computer trying to will yourself to work, and then eight hours later you feel like you&#8217;ve gotten almost nothing done, but you&#8217;ve also been at a desk the entire time. And so it just feels like a complete waste of a day because you didn&#8217;t do any work work, you didn&#8217;t do any not work work, you did nothing, and it&#8217;s a really bad feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your life history, your experiences with ADHD up to this point, any other life trauma you have, it can even start to create this really like negative internal feelings of self for some people. You know, especially if you&#8217;re one of those folks that grew up undiagnosed and were just told that you&#8217;re lazy, and this shouldn&#8217;t be that hard, and see how easy that was, it can really make you feel terrible inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I&#8217;ve learned is that trying to fight that is a path to failure. When you&#8217;re in that kind of mood, no amount of just staring at a screen is going to work for you. So there&#8217;s a few different things you can do that will help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them is, a lot of traditional productivity advice talks about picking your biggest task first, so you get it out of the way, or like eating the large frog first is how I&#8217;ve sometimes heard this described, which is disgusting analogy. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve heard. And because ADHD brains have a lot of inertia, right, getting you moving, the big task will just overwhelm you, you won&#8217;t get anything done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I often tell people is pick the smallest, easiest, most insignificant task first. Doesn&#8217;t even necessarily have to be work related, right? So it could be like, I have this phone call I&#8217;ve been putting off, it&#8217;s only going to take 15 minutes, just make it. Let me respond to some emails, to talk coding stuff for a second, right? There&#8217;s this thing I need to fix, it&#8217;s literally just one line of CSS. Let me go in and make that change, and push it, so that I&#8217;ve done something. That creates a spike of dopamine that gets your brain moving in the right direction. And the next task that you do, that can be a little bit bigger, or another small task, kind of furthers that. So that can help you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of what ADHD management comes down to is really dopamine regulation, right? You could do things like consume some caffeine, coffee, tea, soda. If you have a prescription for ADHD medication, and you take it intermittently, that would probably be a good day to take your ADHD medication, because the whole point of ADHD medication is to increase dopamine production, or stop your brain from absorbing what it does make, so that more of it floats around in your head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing that works really well for me personally is doing physical tasks. So exercise will spike your dopamine, and being outside in the sun will as well. So if you can exercise outdoors, you get the double whammy. I&#8217;ve decided in old age I&#8217;m going to start gardening. That&#8217;s become my midlife crisis, and for me that usually involves moving lots of heavy rocks around and ripping out weeds and doing stuff like that. So I get a two for one, which is great. And then my yard looks nice, so it&#8217;s a win, win, win. Or even just doing like rote, zen-like tasks around the house, like folding laundry, doing dishes, vacuuming. Anything where you turn your brain off for a little bit can be really, really, helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea is you want to step away from the thing that you&#8217;re not able to do, because you&#8217;re not, staring at it for X number of hours isn&#8217;t going to get it done. You need to go do something completely different. It&#8217;s almost like turning your brain off and back on again, right? Like the old, like the computer thing. It&#8217;s just continuing to try to work through the pinwheel, isn&#8217;t going to do it for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> A question following on from that is, if you are in an environment like I am, where I&#8217;m a freelancer, I&#8217;ve got real autonomy over my day, so should I wish to go and garden, that&#8217;s fine. I can do that and I can make it all up. But if I&#8217;m sitting in an environment where I have a boss, and I say to the boss, I just got to do something else for a bit. In a neurotypical world that&#8217;s, no, no, no, you are here, you arrive at nine o&#8217;clock, you punch in the card, and you are going at five, and in between those hours you&#8217;re there, that&#8217;s your desk and these are your tasks, now carry on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I presume there&#8217;d have to be some relationship there. An explanation to the employer would be a good idea. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m trying to get to there, but do you understand what I&#8217;m meaning?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:10] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Absolutely, yeah. There&#8217;s a few different paths you can take here. So, work from home, remote work has been a huge boon for a lot of folks with ADHD and other neurodivergent kind of conditions, because it lets you work when, where, and how works best for you. Sometimes, I know employers have been really keen on spyware on computers and stuff, to track when you&#8217;re at your desk and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But setting that aside for a minute, there&#8217;s two paths you can take. One of them is you make your own accommodations and you ask for forgiveness, not permission. In certain employer contexts I have done that, and my feeling on that is that, if you&#8217;re getting the work done, or you&#8217;re taking accommodations for yourself that allow you to be more productive and function better as an employee, and you&#8217;re not messing up anybody else&#8217;s work output, I have no moral or ethical issue with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if taking 20 minutes away from your desk means that you can come back and be more productive throughout the day, that&#8217;s actually better than not doing that. The other option, one that I have also done very successfully at different employers, is to disclose that I have ADHD and ask for different accommodations at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK has laws around this, the US has laws around this. In many countries, employers are allowed to, are required rather, to provide a reasonable, quote unquote, reasonable accommodations for, or I think in the UK they call it reasonable adjustments, for workers with disabilities or health conditions. In America this is guided by the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s helpful if you have a professional diagnosis. In some countries it may be required. In the US it&#8217;s actually not because we have medical disclosure laws that prohibit an employer from requiring an official doctor&#8217;s note to say, you have to do this. So you can ask for accommodations without the official diagnosis. That is the employer&#8217;s discretion if they&#8217;re reasonable, it&#8217;s a whole complicated system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are like a bunch of things you can ask for that potentially help you. For example, you could ask for a work from home, or partial work from home arrangement, so that you can avoid the distractions of an office. You could ask for a private, quiet space to work in, if you&#8217;re in an open office environment. You could ask for meeting free days, or asynchronous standups to avoid interrupting you mid hyper focus or midday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some folks find that they don&#8217;t work best nine to five. Like for me, my peak performance happens between ten and two, and six and ten. And so I schedule my work around those buckets of productivity. And depending on how your employer is set up, you might be able to ask for irregular work hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there&#8217;s particular types of work you find interesting, you could ask to have more autonomy over the tasks that you choose to work on, or shorter meetings, or fewer meetings, or more frequent breaks. Again, over at a ADHD FTW, I have a whole bunch of information on asking for accommodations at work, including suggestions of things you could ask for, and stuff you can do if you don&#8217;t feel ready to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one caveat here that I just, I really want to acknowledge, I am a cisgendered, heterosexual white man, and I feel like I have an immense amount of professional privilege that means, when I say to my employer, hey, I have ADHD, and it would be really helpful if. I don&#8217;t feel like I have a bunch of other stuff that puts me under scrutiny already from my employer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have talked to friends and students who are in the LGBTQ community, or are in a minority, or are women, and they have told me that they feel less comfortable sometimes disclosing their ADHD at work. Because they already feel like they&#8217;re under more scrutiny from their employer, and they don&#8217;t want something else that causes the employer to look at their work with more scrutiny than the employer might their peers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just want to put that out there as like the, I understand the privilege of being able to just say, hey, I have this thing that makes it harder for me to work sometime, and I want to tell you about it, person who pays me to do work. There&#8217;s obviously a bit of a, depending on your work culture and your work environment, there can be a risk there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I generally recommend, if you&#8217;re going to disclose, like I&#8217;ve even seen some job applications that ask if you have a disability, and I recommend not disclosing that ahead of time. Let them interview you, let them determine if you would be a good fit first, and then tell them, and ask for accommodations. Because every work environment is going to be a little different, and the accommodations I need in one office environment are very different from the accommodations I might need in another, depending on the work culture there. I don&#8217;t think it benefits you to pre disclose that information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I did once do that. I was in an interview where the interviewer asked me if I, when working on a big project, if I preferred to have multiple, throughout the day check-ins, or if I&#8217;d like to go off and do work for a few days, and then come back and like reconvene. And, Nathan, it probably won&#8217;t surprise you to learn that I favour the latter, because interruptions are very bad for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of saying that, I didn&#8217;t want to seem like I was a hermit who didn&#8217;t like talking to my coworkers. So I was like, I have ADHD and interruptions affect me badly. And the interviewer, she was like, oh, I have ADHD too, and so does our coworker Josh, and so does Mike, the guy who&#8217;s the manager for this role, we all have it, we all work that way, that&#8217;s great. And I got a job offer like three days later. So that time it worked out really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like a lot of this is trusting your gut, playing things by ear, assessing your personal needs and your work environment in their own context, because it&#8217;s one of those things too where ADHD symptoms are a bit of a spectrum. Not everyone has all of the symptoms, not everyone has all of the symptoms all the time. And so your individual ADHD experience, and needs, are almost certainly likely to be different from mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think I&#8217;ve probably asked all of the different questions that I wanted to ask, but it&#8217;s been really fascinating just, first of all, learning about what it is because, as I said at the top, I really did have a great big void there. So I&#8217;ve got an inkling that I&#8217;ve a better understanding, so thank you for that. But also, during the second part, a much greater understanding of what might be remedial things that you can do to introduce productivity if you like, or enhancements to your life, should you have ADHD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we go, Chris, I wonder if you have a moment just to tell us a URL, I mean, I know you&#8217;ve mentioned a few so far already, and we&#8217;ll put those in the show notes. But, you know, if somebody wanted to contact you, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re comfortable sharing email addresses, or Twitter handles, or whatever it might be. So over to you with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:28] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. So if you go to ADHDFTW.com/wptavern, with or without dashes, you can spell it like eight different ways, it&#8217;ll all get you there. I have put together a whole bunch of additional articles and resources that dig deeper into some of the stuff we talked about. I feel like we went pretty deep, but you can go so much deeper on some of this stuff. So I&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of additional resources for folks. If they want it, you can also find my contact information, my email address is chris@gomakethings.com, but you can find that and my social media handles over at the website as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have ADHD, you do have ADHD, and you want to talk about that, or kind of explore some of the challenges, some of the things you feel are working really well for you, you just want to talk about it, I&#8217;m always happy to chat ADHD stuff with folks. So please do feel free to get in touch and reach out. And I also publish every weekday a short email with a tip, or trick, or idea that can help you unlock your ADHD superpowers. So you can sign up for that over at ADHDFTW.com as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Chris Ferdinandi, thank you so much for chatting to me about this really, genuinely interesting subject. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:36] <strong>Chris Ferdinandi:</strong> Thanks for having me, Nathan. This was great.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@cferdinandi\">Chris Ferdinandi</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris, a web developer with ADHD, has navigated both the human resources and web development landscapes. He&#8217;s here to share his unique experiences and insights on how ADHD has shaped his career and daily life, as well as offer practical strategies for managing ADHD in the workplace and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the world of ADHD, exploring the challenges and advantages it brings, especially in a world designed for neurotypical individuals. Chris talks about the abundance of ideas, risk-taking behaviour, and the lack of impulse control that can present both opportunities and obstacles. He candidly discusses how ADHD affects his ability to focus, regulate attention, and how it impacts emotions and impulse control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris refers to ADHD traits as superpowers, and embraces them while also acknowledging the real-world difficulties. He discusses how ADHD individuals often struggle with hyper-focus, and how interruptions can be particularly detrimental to their workflows. He suggests structuring workdays with blocked-off meeting times to maintain focus upon tasks which need doing in the timescales required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also touch upon other workplace accommodations, the importance of understanding ADHD subtypes, and navigating disclosure in professional settings.

I am Courtney Robertson. Robert&#8217;s not able to be with me today, but I have a fantastic guest lined up for us. Today we&#8217;re going to talk with Malcolm Peralty. Malcolm, have I pronounced your last name correctly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />You did great, yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />Okay, fantastic. So a lot of the WordPress community knows Malcolm or has encountered working with Malcolm in various places, but these days Malcolm is in the Drupal community too. So we&#8217;re going to first start out with learning a little bit about your background and WordPress. Before we get onto that, can you tell us a little bit about your background with WordPress? I looked up your profile before when I was doing my homework to come up with some questions for you, and I saw that your WordPress profile is from 2005. So that tells me you&#8217;re not new to this space. Tell me a little more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />So I originally started with WordPress back with version 0.72, which is kind of the first mainstream release of WordPress. I was not too long out of college at that point. I was all excited about PHP development. I did not want to reinvent the wheel and develop my own CMS, so I thought, well, geez, I need something. I have to publish online. I have all these things that I want to get out. I was using Blogger at the time and writing the rest of the code for my website myself. So my blog was on Blogger, and the rest of my website was PHP. Then I pulled in WordPress and said, wow, geez, I could do my whole website with this. I ended up as a full-time blogger writing about WordPress back around WordPress 1.0 on bloggingpro.com, which was actually in the WordPress newsfeed at the time. I did some podcasts with Charles Stricklin, co-hosted on the WordPress podcast with Charles Stricklin back in the day, and have done multiple different podcasts with Jeff Chandler. I worked as a project manager for 10up, doing support and marketing for Gravity Forms. I&#8217;ve worked with Canberra Creative as well as a few other WordPress agencies or multi-CMS agencies. Yeah, I&#8217;ve done a little bit of everything in the WordPress community. I&#8217;ve been very, very, very fortunate. It&#8217;s been a long career. We&#8217;re coming up on 20 years or so, which just seems outrageous, but it&#8217;s been amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />Yeah. So WordPress 1.0, goodness! I found it around version 2.4, so I was a little early into this, but my profile wasn&#8217;t made for a couple of years after that. I have to ask, you said that you realized you could build your whole website with WordPress. Those of us that have been in this space for a long time know that originally WordPress was just there for blogging purposes. There were no pages, no sidebars, no widgets. Those were all fancy new features that came much later along. When you began using WordPress to build your entire website, was it still when it was intended to be just for blogging? Were you much of a hacker?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yeah, so I think the other pages that I had were individual blog posts that I had listed on those pages. So my about page was a blog post about me that I just had on a specific page. So I had it in the navigation, and I think I did that for all the pages of content back then. So that&#8217;s how I built out my website with a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />Hilarious. I remember those days, how to register sidebars and add widgets, and do things that it wasn&#8217;t really originally intended to do. It&#8217;s good to talk with people from that era of time. I should look up some of those old posts about WordPress from that era. Oh gosh, the screenshots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />They&#8217;re brutal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />Yep. Wayback Machine is there for all of us, absolutely. So you and I last crossed paths at the first-ever WordCamp Canada. I think it was our second time meeting up. We met up originally, was it Buffalo I think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yep, that&#8217;s correct. Two years ago in Buffalo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />So Canada was, I think, a huge success. It was a great camp. Can you tell folks a little bit more about your time at WordCamp Canada and also what you specifically were doing there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />So I kind of dip my toe in and out of WordCamps from time to time. I find it a great way to reconnect, especially in this post-COVID era. It&#8217;s really nice to see some friendly faces that I know I share an interest with. And so when I heard about WordCamp Canada, I was all over that. One of the things that I kind of jokingly did was submit a topic of wanting to discuss working remotely for American companies in Canada. I&#8217;ve been able to do that for the majority of my career, so I thought, I&#8217;ll submit this. I highly doubt they&#8217;ll take it because a lot of WordCamps typically are more engineering-focused, how you can do cool things with WordPress, they have beginner tracks, but typically those are how to start with WordPress from almost a technical perspective. Some of these social topics or more career-focused topics usually get a thumbs down, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think WordCamp Canada was one of the first times I saw that there was a very heavy kind of social track related to accessibility, inclusivity, employment, and globalization. So all of those topics were really kind of focused on and highlighted. And so they said yes to my presentation. It was a really nice opportunity to share the experiences that I&#8217;ve had, and I hope that someone out there will look at international employment opportunities in a new way and stop limiting themselves because my career would be half of what it is if I hadn&#8217;t kind of pushed myself to deal with the ins and outs of working for American companies for the majority of my career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />I actually had a chance to be in the audience for that talk, which was great. And I was looking at it from the lens of I&#8217;m an American with many Canadian coworkers, and I like to understand some of the unique things that they might be facing that I just might not be aware of. What are some of the challenges that they&#8217;re facing in their line of work? And then also we&#8217;re allowed to, at my place of employment at GoDaddy, we&#8217;re allowed to side hustle with other things. And so if I were to ever contract somebody that is working in Canada, what things should I be mindful of that they&#8217;re facing? So I think it was a great talk even for those that were not able to be present. But I expect that the videos for WordCamp Canada will have been uploaded to WordPress.tv. I believe they&#8217;re all in the queue right now and just awaiting the publishing of a few of them. So do feel free, folks, to go check that out on WordPress.tv, look for WordCamp Canada and Malcolm, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find it. So you took work at Acquia, which is outside the WordPress community completely. First of all, many folks in this audience, we&#8217;re the Do the Woo network here, and that means that people are keyed into what&#8217;s going on specifically with WooCommerce, which is a subset of WordPress. Acquia is so not WordPress. Can you tell us what Acquia is known for and what led you to consider work outside of the WordPress bubble?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yeah, so Acquia is the Drupal mothership in the same way that Automattic is for WordPress. Dries, the founder of Drupal, is the CTO of the company. So it&#8217;s a slightly different role than Matt Mullenweg has at Automattic. But the two companies have so many parallels. They&#8217;re very similar in so many ways. So if you know anything about Automattic, you kind of inherently know stuff about Acquia. It&#8217;s a product-focused company based around Drupal, and I never expected to work there. That was a strange coincidence. A lot of my career has been strange coincidences in terms of timing and kind of being bold enough to say yes to things that other people might say no to. So the company I was working for at the time had been acquired. I was their WordPress expert. I think the role was something like web strategist or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they had been acquired and the writing was kind of on the wall. They were integrating multiple companies. They weren&#8217;t going to need multiple web people to help them out. I was doing the math and said, I&#8217;m not going to take a risk on my career and wait and see if I&#8217;m the one that survives the Hunger Games. I was talking to Ian Gupta, who I knew from way back in the day, and he had, not recently, but I was interested in getting my Agile certification. He had done that. He was in my contact list on LinkedIn. So I reached out and said, how did you find that? Next thing I knew, he was like, yeah, I&#8217;m working for Acquia now as a technical account manager. Would you ever consider working for Acquia? And I was like, I had never, but I would be open to that discussion. Through the interviewing process, the whole way through, I was like, they&#8217;re not going to hire me. They&#8217;re not going to hire me. I&#8217;m a WordPress guy for the most part, they&#8217;re not going to hire me. And so when the offer came in to actually hire me, I was kind of like, uh-oh, what have I done? This</p>\n\n\n\n<p>is very different from anything that I had done before. And I was a little worried, a little concerned, but I mean, for those that have had the opportunity to work for Acquia and enjoyed their experience or some of the other large WordPress organizations, in a way, Acquia has that same kind of mentality, that same kind of mindset, and it has continued to be an amazing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />That&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s really exciting to be able to hear that. So in your role of technical account manager, my understanding of WordPress versus Drupal is that early on, in the before times, before we had sidebars and pages, Drupal traditionally led the way with more of the robust enterprise level of websites. They had a lot of inroads with higher ed and large-scale corporations, and WordPress was originally seen as though it&#8217;s just that blogging platform even after it could handle a full CMS. Is that still true for Drupal today? And what can you tell me about maybe where Drupal is going these days? I know a little bit about the Starshot initiative. I&#8217;ve read a little bit on what&#8217;s going on with that one, but what kind of users are selecting Drupal, and who&#8217;s the primary audience? We know that WordPress can do all of it, and WordPress is for everybody that wants to be able to publish. But do we still find that Drupal is primarily handling these enterprise-scale kind of websites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />For the most part, that is still the expected use case for Drupal. That is changing and transforming because there are only so many enterprise companies that exist, which I think speaks volumes to the difference in market share between the two CMSs. I think Drupal is at around 1% of the web, where WordPress is at 30-some-odd percent of the web and 50% of the CMS usage, and Drupal is at like 2% of CMS usage. So very different goals and focuses. I remember early on when I started using Drupal in some project management work, the joke was, oh, if you wanted some quick and easy blogging system, you kind of tacked on WordPress inside a Drupal install. And that was the way you gave that functionality to people who didn&#8217;t necessarily have the technical chops or the ability to deal with the learning curve of Drupal. In terms of a cultural perspective, from my experience within the Drupal community, there&#8217;s still this assumption that WordPress is inferior in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not really good because there&#8217;s still a concern that the security isn&#8217;t quite there or the robustness in terms of translations and these kinds of custom field-related things don&#8217;t really exist within WordPress core, and so it&#8217;s just not as good. Then the second opinion that I see a lot of is that Drupal and WordPress are so different that they shouldn&#8217;t even be directly compared. Why even have that conversation? A coworker of mine likes to say Drupal is like a data relationship system with CMS functionality, and WordPress is a blogging system with CMS functionality, right? So he sees it from a completely different angle. I&#8217;ve showed him Advanced Custom Fields, I&#8217;ve shown him WE LOT, I&#8217;ve shown him some of the functionality that can be added to WordPress relatively easily to give a lot of those similar feelings and functions that they&#8217;re used to in Drupal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually been internally spending a little bit of time at Acquia pointing out some WordPress-related things from time to time to let everyone know that most of their knowledge is several years out of date. They&#8217;re still thinking WordPress is WordPress 2.0; they have no idea what&#8217;s happened in the last 3, 5, 7 years in WordPress. So their opinions are really skewed based on that historical memory of what WordPress was. I&#8217;m trying to bring them up to date with what it actually is today, and that&#8217;s been a really fun project. You mentioned Starshot, which apparently they&#8217;re going to call Drupal CMS, which I think is kind of a lame name because Drupal is a CMS. So calling Starshot &#8220;Drupal CMS,&#8221; I don&#8217;t understand that, but I&#8217;m not the decision-maker there. But its entire focus is improving Drupal from a skilled site builder perspective, which reminds me so much of what WordPress has done with Gutenberg, and I think it is the perfect direction for Drupal to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />Yeah, I was reading a little bit about it on Dries&#8217; website. I&#8217;m still a diehard RSS reader, and as I was reading through the direction of that, what the WordPress community may know of Drupal is that you can integrate Gutenberg into Drupal. You can have the Gutenberg experience in the equivalent of a post editor. Maybe what the Drupal community needs to know is that we are working on core fields. The table will be gathering at WordCamp US with Scott Clark at the helm on that one for the Core Fields API. Because of the data views that are going on inside of when you go to edit your theme, setting up the configuration that&#8217;s necessary there, it&#8217;s becoming apparent that we need that to the point where it was called out at WordCamp US last year during Matt&#8217;s Q&amp;A. Oh, that Drupal has this core fields area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s pretty interesting though for a few reasons. Basically, it seemed to me like there were almost three flavors in Dries&#8217; post about how one could select what variety of Drupal they would like to experience. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that? And on this, which was actually put forward as the strategy plan? I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve ever seen a strategy plan as it relates. We see our big picture goals for the year-end WordPress, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen a strategy plan fully published in the WordPress space. Can you tell us more about those areas a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yeah. So I think this whole thing with Starshot reminds me of the &#8220;learn JavaScript deeply&#8221; call that Matt made for WordPress. This is a call to everyone to say, look, we realize that the transition right now for CMSs is, how do we empower marketers and site builders to execute on their goals? They&#8217;re driving the decisions about the CMS, they&#8217;re driving the choices. It&#8217;s not the IT team. They&#8217;re managing the updates maybe, but they&#8217;re certainly not driving the decision of what CMS to use. And so how can we appeal to that audience? Even today, it requires a fair bit of technical understanding to install and run a Drupal site. There&#8217;s no five-minute install like in WordPress. It requires an understanding of Composer, it requires an understanding of YAML files. It is not simple, easy, or fun. Then when you get into the interface, it feels a little bit clunky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t feel super modern. If you compare it to Webflow and WordPress and modern Squarespace and Wix, while they&#8217;re not necessarily aiming for the same businesses, they are in a way aiming for the same end user, which is the site builder, the person publishing the content online. So there&#8217;s a couple of different pieces there. One is this thing called recipes, which is really cool to me. The idea that you could, at any point in the process during the installation or later on, pick and choose what functionality you want. So let&#8217;s say you want a marketing website with a form system and maybe a cool download section on your website. Maybe you think of some other features that you want in there. You want user-generated content on your website. With recipes, you&#8217;ll be able to select those things, and it will not just install the plugins, which are called modules in Drupal, but it&#8217;ll also help with the configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then once I have my site fully configured and ready to go, I can download that as a recipe and share it out. Recipes can be as small as passwords expire in 90 days, or they can be as big as here&#8217;s a full CMS system with all of these things pre-configured for you—all these modules pre-selected, the theme ready to go, user settings, additional fields, all this stuff just ready to go out of the box with this little special recipe file. You can then add additional recipe files on top of that and mix and match to your heart&#8217;s content to build up your perfect version of Drupal. I think that is such a really interesting way to go. I can imagine how something similar to that would be useful in the WordPress space, especially for those that are running multiple hundreds of sites, or maybe even for GoDaddy to come up with kind of like this is the GoDaddy install of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not just the plugins and themes, but it&#8217;s even maybe the configuration options because out of the box, we all know that WordPress has some configuration options that we, by default, on autopilot, go and change because we know that&#8217;s not really how we want our site to be, right? We don&#8217;t want the permalinks to be like S equals 243. We want pretty permalinks, so we change that. We want our assets to be uploaded probably to year and month folders, so we go and change that. How nice would it be to have a way to just have those all set by default through this recipe system? And so that&#8217;s one of the many things that&#8217;s coming with this Starshot experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />I really like that. I think that in the WordPress space for the DIY crowd, I would say what we have in the hosting space, coming from working at GoDaddy and knowing that my competitors are offering similar, is a lot of use of AI for the onboarding wizard experience. So you say, I want to open a pizza shop, I want to open a cafe, or I&#8217;m opening up maybe a fashion boutique or something like that. Based upon what you indicate you want, it will walk you through and create a basic five-page site. You need to change the content to be your own. It will give you some free stock images that you&#8217;re permitted to use, but ideally, you would swap those out for your own. It will help guide you towards selecting the appropriate color</p>\n\n\n\n<p>scheme, etc. You could default to say, here is the font choice for my brand, here is the whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think about that at the DIY level, that&#8217;s pretty cool. But agencies tend to not want AI to get in their way at the spin-up phase. What I like about Starshot is that the agencies that are building the sites for customers have a means of selecting that. Perhaps it could be made more GUI or easier even for agencies, but I think the first step is to understand what the agencies need. I think Drupal tends to historically be primarily agency folks. Unless you&#8217;re a developer that just wants to learn Drupal, I don&#8217;t know too many hobbyists that go to Drupal and learn all of Drupal to get up and going, though I could be wrong—happy to be wrong about that. But yeah, it looks to be pretty interesting to see where that&#8217;s going. I really like tuning in to read Dries&#8217; blog posts, like I said, but I also really enjoy when I get a chance to see his equivalent of the state of the word, his annual address to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as, I really enjoyed the video that I saw where Matt had invited Dries and Mike Little, co-founder of WordPress, to Automattic&#8217;s Grand Meetup. So Automattic, as a company, has an annual grand meetup where they invite everybody together. I thought that interview or that time was actually quite unique. I really love to hear from what other open-source projects are doing and how we can benefit each other in the open-source space. Sure, we have competitors. I could say, yes, I&#8217;m at GoDaddy and I know what my competitors are doing, but also my friends work at those places. As a whole, it&#8217;s on us to care for the shared customers and community. Included in that are things like, oh yes, we do make Drupal hosting available to our customers. And in the process of that, I think about issues like what&#8217;s going on in PHP and the push as PHP continues—it&#8217;s under both of our projects, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as PHP continues to push forward with how quickly they&#8217;re iterating upon the language compared to historically in the past, well, our customers are all going to face the challenges and the struggles of that. Working at a hosting company, it&#8217;s on my mind. I might think about it from the WordPress lens first, but certainly, it applies across the board. What do the other things that we offer that are also very PHP-based deal with, and how do we address those needs too? So that leads into the next question or the next topic. There are some of the overlapping roles of open source in both of our ecosystems. I&#8217;ve met several folks in the Drupal space. Some of them I&#8217;ve actually got lined up coming in the near future. AmyJune Hineline has overlapped in both WordPress and Drupal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AmyJune is one of the mentors of mentors. There is a mentorship program in the Drupal space, and I have several friends that have been a part of that in their early web dev learning journey. It&#8217;s more about learning to use and implement Drupal, whereas in WordPress, our mentorship program is primarily more around getting up and running as a contributor if you would like to be a contributor. We have a mentorship program specific to contributors to all of the teams. We both have really big user bases across both WordPress and Drupal. What are some of the other interesting challenges that you&#8217;ve seen? What role does Acquia have in that? For instance, with the WordPress mentorship program, we see a lot of Automattic staff primarily facilitating and leading that. What&#8217;s Acquia doing to help foster contribution to Drupal? What&#8217;s Acquia doing, or what is Drupal as a project also doing related to any kind of challenges in the open-source space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yeah, I&#8217;ll be honest, I haven&#8217;t really dived much into this yet. Primarily at Acquia, our focus is on the products and services we provide. While Dries and others talk about open source and are the lead drummers of that ideal, I think, like many of the bigger WordPress companies, there&#8217;s a lot of kind of closed or proprietary things that are happening that&#8217;ll probably never be spun off and freely given to the communities as open-source versions. That isn&#8217;t to say that there are no contributions to open source, and actually, TAMs are recommended to provide time back to open-source projects or help resolve issues with different modules. In my opinion, the open-source community across the board has really taken a backseat to profitability over the last couple of years, especially as the number of subscription-based themes, plugins, and services for both continues to grow. There&#8217;s less of that tinker, hacker, freedom fighter mentality of the early days that both of these CMSs used to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />Yeah, that makes sense. I do aspire to bring some of the learnings of what&#8217;s going on both in one project to the other. One of those that&#8217;s on my radar right now, I&#8217;m actively working on the contributor dashboards for the WordPress project and how folks are being recognized—I’ll say it that way; I don&#8217;t want to say tracked. It&#8217;s more about are we recognizing the various efforts? One of the things that I really responded to a lot about Drupal is that Drupal has a means of logging your contribution efforts. It&#8217;s a bit of a manual process at this time, whereas some of the tooling that we&#8217;re looking at for contributor dashboards in WordPress would be rather automated—getting activity on how many Slack messages one might be sending that are in public channels, specifying that, or GitHub activity. Whereas there are folks doing a lot of hidden labor like reading posts, somebody might scoff about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for those who want to have a deep historical knowledge about the project, the act of reading posts and researching—there&#8217;s no way to automate tracking that activity. So Drupal has a really interesting way of doing that. I&#8217;ve thought about bringing something akin to that. For those that do more of that hidden type of work, wherever it is never going to be practical to get activity metrics, anywhere that we could get activity metrics, let&#8217;s build an automation for that. But if it does not make sense to do activity metrics, some means of logging that time in a more manual process—I feel like the more that we can continue to recognize the value of contributors in open source, the better we are as stewards of various open-source projects. I think we can serve as examples to how open source should be for other projects probably yet to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been doing some deep thinking around that lately in my specific day-to-day work. I&#8217;m excited to see where that one goes. Looking ahead, what do you think the future for Drupal with Acquia leading some of the major initiatives will look like? In WordPress, we see Automattic generally leads the way with what we are doing with Gutenberg, with the community team as far as events go, and we&#8217;re grateful for that ability, but we also see that there is a need for more organizations to step up and step in to facilitate some of that. How do you see that shaking out with Acquia in particular as it relates to Drupal? Do you see the same tensions in the community perhaps about the direction of the project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Very much so. Again, there are mirror images of each other in so many ways. It feels like right now, especially the Drupal community is taking pages out of the modern WordPress playbook. I will say that with WordPress, there isn&#8217;t the same kind of marketing team with Drupal that some of the closed-source hosted enterprise CMS systems have. So in some ways, expansion for Drupal will come from trying to entice more people to work on the project. I think that we have a very similar percentage of third-party companies working on it, but I think we&#8217;re struggling. I think, just like the WordPress community is starting to as well, where a lot of the contributors are—no offense—they&#8217;re getting a little older. I had someone once say to me, the biggest mistake that Drupal&#8217;s made was turning away from being a CMS option for the local mom-and-pop shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because once that happened, young developers had a hard time getting started with Drupal, and the project lost some important continuance of fresh, young, and new ideas. I&#8217;m seeing that as I&#8217;m participating more and more in this community, they&#8217;re trying to go, oh shoot, we kind of shot ourselves in the foot here about the future of Drupal. How do we fix that before the old guard all sail off into the distance, so to speak? Making it more innovative, reducing the friction in using the software, I think, will be a big part of that. One of the major changes that I have a lot of enterprise customers lament is how quick Drupal is versioning right now. It&#8217;s just constant new versions coming out. I think there was only a year and a half between the first version of Drupal 10 and the Drupal 11 release that came out, which is incredibly fast for the Drupal community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, there are still a lot of sites running Drupal 7 and have been running it forever and would love to just run it forever. But the goal now is, how can we iterate on Drupal in a way that it can innovate while maintaining some of that backward compatibility so that we don&#8217;t break things, so that we can release more often, and have upgrades more often, and just make that a seamless part of using Drupal? Again, that reminds me a lot of what WordPress has done. It&#8217;s a lot of versions—I think three to four a year. I don&#8217;t think Drupal&#8217;s going to iterate that quickly, but that is the goal. Again, it reminds me so much of what WordPress is doing. Then from an Automattic versus Acquia perspective, I think it&#8217;s very similar. We try to point the direction that we see based on the clients that we have in hopes that we as a company are helping lead the project well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are still definitely a</p>\n\n\n\n<p>lot of different voices with different interests and focuses as we move forward. I think there are a lot of people out there that don&#8217;t see the value in Starshot, that don&#8217;t see the value in appealing to the experienced builder, who think that it should remain a very developer-centric CMS platform because that provides the comfort and security that they&#8217;re used to. But I think there&#8217;s a diminishing market for that kind of CMS, and I think that this new project or this new direction is such a breath of fresh air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />I would agree there. That kind of reminds me a little bit about the needs of the users, not just from the contributor space, but also from the user space, how the needs of the users of projects are evolving. It used to be that we were just asking for pages in WordPress or sidebars back when I remember that. That&#8217;s how I learned PHP—registering a sidebar to stick a widget in the side, and I had to learn a lot about PHP. I didn&#8217;t really have any mentors or anyone to help me through that experience. Oh boy, was that a challenge, especially when there weren&#8217;t nearly as many materials online for teaching me this as there are these days. So one of the hot issues that I see right now across these are areas like accessibility, the need for improving accessibility. You mentioned the hot-button word of backward compatibility and where that stands. I know that Drupal has had some differences compared to WordPress in pushing updates when we have releases and the cadence of the releases. It&#8217;s funny that in WordPress, folks so much lament, why does it take so long to get whatever? And also lament, oh my goodness, you&#8217;re shipping so many releases in a year. Meanwhile, Drupal&#8217;s like, oh, it&#8217;s only a year and a half. We could do it. And that&#8217;s making waves in a year and a half. I don&#8217;t know enough about Drupal to know if in that year and a half they&#8217;re shipping many features in that change. I also don&#8217;t know which versions are or are not backward compatible. Where do you see that shaking out in the different communities?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yeah, so the learning curve for Drupal is steep. I&#8217;ve mentioned that before, but one of the reasons for that is there are some externalities that both CMSs have. Drupal depends on CKEditor for its editing experience. So when CKEditor 4 went end of life, Drupal had to upgrade to CKEditor 5. When Composer upgrades, Drupal needs to update to the new version of Composer. There are some other projects within Drupal that also push that along. Then of course, we have the upgrades of PHP, the upgrades of MySQL. So there are all these externalities that have to be managed through this process. So it&#8217;s not wholly on the CMS to determine when these releases happen in some ways, right? Because we want to continue that secure, performant, and accessible tool. In terms of accessibility, I will say a lot of people in the Drupal community have this strong belief that Drupal is much more accessible than WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I think it really comes down to the company that&#8217;s developing. With the additional things that you add on top of it, like WordPress core on its own is very accessible, but you add a really crummy theme and some crummy plugins, and guess what? You can&#8217;t use it anymore. And that&#8217;s very similar to Drupal. There are agencies that are not as good at accessibility, and when they develop a theme for Drupal to publish a site online, it&#8217;s not accessible. Or when they create a module for Drupal to add some functionality and they don&#8217;t do it in an accessible way, guess what? The admin panel is no longer accessible. There&#8217;s been some complaints about CKEditor not being as accessible as some people would like in terms of the version that&#8217;s integrated with Drupal. So again, there are always these ebbs and flows, and it really depends on these third parties. So I really dislike the conversation of is WordPress accessible or is Drupal accessible? And if we take it down to the core, the answer for both is yes, but as soon as you change anything or add anything, then the answer might be no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />And the answer for a logged-in user that is in the edit interface as opposed to the front-end website visitor also could be vastly different about that too. And that&#8217;s just even with core for both of them. Yeah, so it&#8217;s something that I think we all could benefit from learning about for sure. So let&#8217;s skip ahead to what advice do you have for others in the community? Those who have been longtime contributors and are considering branching out like you have. I know some WordPress people that are itching to look beyond the WordPress experience itself. I am quite happy here. I think there&#8217;s a lot of learning to do, and I love to get into shenanigans where I learn from other open-source projects, and I hope that we can share our knowledge together and benefit all of our communities through that. But I know some folks that are looking to different shores, we&#8217;ll say. What advice do you have for them and how could they start preparing if they&#8217;re interested in jumping ship to somewhere like Acquia? Or leaving the standard CMS space for other kinds of flavors of web dev?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yeah, I will say hopefully through this discussion, anyone, no matter which open-source project you&#8217;re on, especially if it&#8217;s a PHP, MySQL-developed CMS, you can easily transition from one to the other. And there are some amazing opportunities there. I would highly recommend if you are a WordPress developer or you&#8217;re a Drupal developer and you&#8217;ve been in that space for a long period of time, take a short break and go check out what the other is doing. You might be able to contribute some important refinements due to your experience. You might be able to identify a path that your CMS choice went down only to find a dead end, and you could save countless hours of tinkering by dozens of people by bringing that up. You might see features or functions or ideas that you could bring back to the tool that you favor. So there&#8217;s a huge amount of opportunity there, and especially right now with all of the transitions and changes that have happened in WordPress over the last couple of years and the ones that are being queued up for Drupal over the next little while, this would be a great time to just kind of peek in and see what the other is doing and take some learnings from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because while both CMSs typically target different types of customers, so to speak, I think that there&#8217;s a lot to learn from each other. There&#8217;s a lot of opportunities for time savings, and there&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know necessarily that it&#8217;ll become one homogenous CMS someday, but I think that there are advantages that each has that each should be looking to incorporate into their own right. And so we should be hoping to see those kinds of opportunities and transitions. I will say from someone who&#8217;s been in the WordPress space primarily for the last 20 years, going to a more niche CMS means that there&#8217;s a little bit less competition in a way. So your opportunity for contribution, in a way, is larger, right? Your potential impact is larger, and sometimes the salaries are higher. So explore those things, explore those opportunities, and push yourself to learn new things. I know that if and when I ever come back to the WordPress community and work in WordPress again, the things that I&#8217;ll have learned through this process will be so valuable in that effort. So no new knowledge is wasted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />Absolutely. What kinds of things right now, in a more timely fashion, we&#8217;ve talked about our Drupal community and the WordPress community and the learnings between them—what kind of things in open source, whether they be new open-source projects, any kind of dependencies—you mentioned PHP, MySQL—being aware of what these things that we depend upon in our open-source projects are doing, or any other kinds of trends, things that are on your radar that are more news related?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Yeah, I love full-site editing in WordPress. I remember when the idea first came out, people were saying that at some point, maybe WordPress would only have one base theme and we would all just install different block and patterns packs or style packs. I still believe that could be a long-term direction for themes in WordPress. I think that the Experience Builder in Drupal is potentially trying to develop something similar. I know Webflow has really kind of focused in on the freedom of design in an interesting way. I think being able to easily implement an idea on the web will empower so many people, and I&#8217;m really excited about that. Personally, one of the things that&#8217;s impacted me the most at work is there&#8217;s an open-source tool called Rooney, which allows me to scan Drupal websites and get an understanding of what&#8217;s going on with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been able to start writing my own policies and profiles, which allows me to take data that I think is valuable or interesting about the Drupal install and the server configuration and the traffic and the logs, and parse that out in valuable ways for my customers. I wish I had that back in the WordPress world because being able to type in a command in the command line and get a really nice HTML report that I can then tease little details out of has just been—oh my goodness, it&#8217;s the chef&#8217;s kiss of my job in a way. So I really love that and would love to see someone take a look at that and maybe generate something like that for WordPress before I go back to that space. If I do someday, that ability to analyze, to take in all of these various data sources and turn them into graphs and charts and stats in a way that is useful and actionable—it&#8217;s so empowering and I hope to continue to see those kinds of tools get more time and attention. I&#8217;m actually trying to push Acquia to really spend some money—basically some people time—and say, hey, look, we&#8217;re actually going to sponsor this project because it&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so important internally to our team that we want to make sure that it never goes away and that it continues to be developed, supported, and grown. So Rooney is my thing that I think is really cool from a technical perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />I think I might need a link for that. Thank you so much for the past 40 minutes or so here that we&#8217;ve been together. Is there anybody else that you think we should have on the show?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />I have two quick suggestions. Brent Schultz from Third and Grove—he worked with me at 10up. He has a deep knowledge of both WordPress and Drupal from an engineering perspective, and I think that would be super interesting. Being a VP of a large multi-CMS agency, he can provide information on the keyword &#8220;composable architecture,&#8221; being able to take a bunch of different tools and combine them and create them into these custom solutions. I think he would be amazing for that. Then my second one was—I asked my boss this question: if I&#8217;m asked who should go on the show, who should I mention? He said Ron Northcutt, head of Developer Relations at Appsmith, would be great. He had a deep interest in trying to bring more e-commerce functionality into Drupal, something that is often pushed off to third-party tools. I think the conversation about the difference between why did WordPress think it was okay to have WooCommerce, but Drupal thought that having any kind of commerce functionality was the wrong approach when Drupal was supposed to be focused on big business and enterprise. And WordPress was supposed to be the mom-and-pop blogger. So I think that conversation would be a lot of fun as well to be able to listen to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courtney:</strong><br />I think that would be fantastic for a Do the Woo show of all places. Absolutely, yes. And one little bit of a plug back—Bob did not ask me to share this, but there is a new show on Do the Woo that is specific for WordPress in the enterprise. That one might be really interesting also for some of the Drupal folks to take a listen to because it is a lot of the top-tier Fortune 50 type of websites, the enterprise agencies behind those, sharing about their experiences and what they need in the WordPress interface and also the WordPress community as it relates to serving their customers. So I&#8217;ll make sure I share a link back for that one with you. Thank you so much, Malcolm, for being with us today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm:</strong><br />Thanks for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Open Talk on Open Source</em></strong>, host <strong>Courtney Robertson</strong> sits down with <strong>Malcolm Peralty, a seasoned expert in both the WordPress and Drupal communities</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With nearly two decades of experience in the open-source space, Malcolm shares his journey from starting with WordPress in its early days to his current role at Acquia, the &#8220;mothership&#8221; of Drupal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation dives deep into the evolution of both platforms, the challenges and opportunities in open source, and the exciting future of content management systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malcolm Peralty&#8217;s Journey</strong>: Malcolm has extensive experience in the WordPress community, having started with WordPress back in its early versions. His career spans various roles, including blogging, project management, and support for major WordPress products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transition to Drupal</strong>: Malcolm transitioned from the WordPress community to working with Drupal at Acquia, highlighting the parallels between the two platforms and the opportunities that come from exploring different open-source projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamp Canada Experience</strong>: Malcolm discussed his experience presenting at WordCamp Canada, where he spoke on working remotely for American companies while based in Canada, and noted the growing focus on social topics in WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Acquia and Drupal&#8217;s Focus</strong>: Acquia plays a similar role for Drupal as Automattic does for WordPress, with a focus on product development. Malcolm’s role at Acquia involves bridging the knowledge gap between the Drupal and WordPress communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drupal&#8217;s Evolution and Starshot Initiative</strong>: The Starshot initiative, now referred to as Drupal CMS, is aimed at improving Drupal for site builders, akin to WordPress’s Gutenberg project. This initiative focuses on making Drupal more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for non-developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comparison Between WordPress and Drupal</strong>: Malcolm highlighted the differences in perception and use cases between WordPress and Drupal, noting that while Drupal is seen as more robust for enterprise-level websites, there’s a growing recognition of WordPress&#8217;s capabilities beyond blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recipes in Drupal</strong>: A key feature in Drupal&#8217;s future is the introduction of &#8220;recipes,&#8221; which allow users to configure and share pre-built site configurations, offering flexibility and ease of use, especially for agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Open Source and Mentorship</strong>: Both WordPress and Drupal have strong mentorship and community support programs, though their focuses differ. Malcolm pointed out the importance of cross-community learning and contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges in Open Source:</strong> Malcolm discussed the challenges facing open-source communities, including the shift from a hacker mentality to profitability, and the need to attract fresh contributors as the original contributors age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future Directions for Drupal</strong>: The Drupal community is looking to reduce friction in using the platform and make it more appealing to a broader audience, particularly as it relates to maintaining backward compatibility and frequent updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advice for Community Members</strong>: Malcolm encourages developers and contributors to explore other open-source projects like Drupal to gain new perspectives and ideas that can be brought back to their original communities, enhancing both personal growth and community innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://peralty.com/about-me/\"><strong>Peralty &#8211; About Me</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://peralty.com/2024/04/05/one-year-at-acquia/\"><strong>One Year at Acquia</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/about-us\"><strong>Acquia &#8211; About Us</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://dri.es/drupal-cms-the-official-name-for-drupal-starshot\"><strong>Dries &#8211; Drupal CMS, the Official Name for Drupal Starshot</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://dri.es/introducing-drupal-starshot-product-strategy\"><strong>Dries &#8211; Introducing Drupal Starshot Product Strategy</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/phoenixfireball/\"><strong>Malcolm Peralty&#8217;s WordPress Profile</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://canada.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/malcolm-peralty/\"><strong>WordCamp Canada 2024 Speaker Profile &#8211; Malcolm Peralty</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://canada.wordcamp.org/2024/session/working-in-wordpress-with-american-companies/\"><strong>WordCamp Canada 2024 Session &#8211; Working in WordPress with American Companies</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 09:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Patched in WPML WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=160485\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/remote-code-execution-vulnerability-patched-in-wpml-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1842:\"<p>The popular WordPress Multilingual plugin, WPML, which is installed on over 1,000,000 websites, has patched a <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2024/08/1000000-wordpress-sites-protected-against-unique-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-wpml-wordpress-plugin/\">Remote Code Execution (RCE)</a> vulnerability (CVE-2024-6386) that researchers have classified as <strong>&#8220;Critical,&#8221; with a CVSS score of 9.9</strong>.

The planning phase of this event will start in September 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers will be involved in weekly or bi-weekly meetings leading up to the event and will <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2025/call-for-organisers/teams/\">work in teams</a> including Budget, Community, Content, and Design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordCamp Europe 2024 in Torino, Italy received prestigious <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/wordcamp-europe-receives-patronage-from-the-european-parliament/\">patronage from the European Parliament</a>, granted by Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament. The event emphasized accessibility and inclusivity and was attended by 2,584 attendees from over 70 countries. The 2023 and 2022 events were heavily criticized by the community for <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/diversity-at-wceu/\">lack of diversity</a> in speaker lineups and organizing teams but the 2024 version more than made up for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe 2025 looks to be on the right track when it comes to accessibility and sustainability. The <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2025/venue/\">venue Messe and Congress Center Basel</a> are fully accessible for people with mobility challenges and prioritize environmental sustainability. However, the event coincides with Eid ul-Adha, a major Muslim holiday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organizers have assured that: &#8220;While we cannot change the dates, the organizing team is committed to making WCEU 2025 more inclusive of attendees who are celebrating Eid ul-Adha. To do this, we will consult with the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) Working Group and attendees of the Muslim community to find initiatives that support them to feel welcome at our event during those dates.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The last date for applying is August 31, 2024, at 23:59 CEST.</strong> While it is recommended that applicants be based within European time zones due to meeting schedules, any WordPress enthusiast from around the globe can apply. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though all WordCamp communications will be in English, knowledge of French or German is essential to apply for the local team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested in hosting WordCamp Europe 2026 are encouraged to apply for the 2025 organizing team to gain valuable experience and insight into event logistics and organizational requirements.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Aug 2024

wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Emma:<br />Welcome, everybody, to another exciting episode of <em>Do the Woo Biz Chat</em>, where we dive deep into the world of WooCommerce and everything that powers successful e-commerce businesses. We are, again, your hosts, Emma Young and Adam Weeks, and we are thrilled to have you here with us today. Hopefully, we can explore some exciting new trends, tips, tools, and anything to help elevate your site to new heights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you, Ms. Emma. Yes, that&#8217;s right. We are joined by Anthony Tran today. He&#8217;s the Marketing Director of Beaver Builder, one of the leading page builders in the WordPress ecosystem. He&#8217;s here to share his expertise on how page builders can revolutionize your WooCommerce site and enhance your customer experience. Anthony, welcome. We are so glad to have you here. We’ve met a few times, and it&#8217;s my pleasure to welcome you onto the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Hey everyone, thanks for having me on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />It&#8217;s good to have you. Anthony, would you mind just sharing with us a little bit about your background, how long you&#8217;ve been at Beaver Builder, and what Beaver Builder is for those who may not know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;d be happy to. So I started my entrepreneurship journey in 2013. I left my corporate job and started a podcast. I was podcasting about digital marketing, and it evolved into creating my own WordPress web design agency. My wife and I were building websites using Beaver Builder in 2014, and that’s how we learned about it. After a couple of years doing the agency work, Beaver Builder was looking for a Marketing Director, and I thought, “Wow, this would be such an awesome opportunity with my marketing background using Beaver Builder.” I joined the team, I think, in 2019. So I&#8217;ve been with them for about five years, and it&#8217;s been a lot of fun. I’m happy to be here and happy to dive into WordPress, Beaver Builder, or wherever you want to take us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />That is the ultimate customer success story! You used it for a web agency, and now you&#8217;re the Director of Marketing. That&#8217;s awesome. Do you happen to know, by any chance, where the name Beaver Builder came from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah, there’s a cool story behind it. Robbie has shared this on a mini-podcast, but basically, when they first created the business, it was called Fastline Page Builder. Not a great name, not great branding, but their agency was Fastline LLC, Fastline Media—sorry, Fastline Media. After their initial launch, it didn’t really take off at first. They had some customers who used it and liked the product, but they said, “Hey, maybe you can work on the brand name.” So Robbie and the guys had to brainstorm. They thought, “Let’s figure out what kind of animal builds something.” I think they came up with some really wacky names at first, like “Oh, spiders create webs,” and “Bees make hives.” One day, Robbie came into the office and said, “What do you think about Beaver Builder?” They all kind of chuckled about it; it was kind of goofy. Then they slept on it and thought, “I like it. It’s got a fun ring to it; it’s fun. It kind of has our personality, and we think it’d be fun. Let’s see what happens.” And of course, the name stuck, and it became what it is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Fantastic. It is memorable. I was at CloudFest in Germany, and we were talking to Robbie. I introduced him to the guy who started Groundhogg, and I was like, “We’ve got groundhogs and beaver builders. WordPress is full of quirky animals.” I wasn’t sure where we could go with that, but it didn’t go anywhere other than it being memorable. So, well done to Robbie for something that sticks in your brain. So, WooCommerce and page builders—what I wanted to pull out of this episode is this idea about where these two intersect, and I’m kind of curious about your take. How does someone know if a page builder is right for them or if it’s not for them if they’re starting a store? What’s your general sense? We’ll kind of start from a high level and then work our way down. From a high level, why would someone want a page builder, Beaver Builder being one of them, but there are a number of them out there. There’s Divi, and these different page builders. Why would someone want to use a page builder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Well, from a high level, page builders are great because if you’re looking to create a website and you maybe don’t know how to code, you’re not a developer, or you just don’t want to code, and you want to be able to easily drag and drop layouts on the front end of your WordPress website, then a page builder is perfect for you. I don’t know if you all remember back in 2013 how building WordPress websites was like—you would pick a theme, and you would get stuck with this certain layout. You could change the colors and fonts a little bit, and every time you adjusted something, you had to refresh your screen, open it up on the front end, and see what it looked like. Well, with page builders, it’s nice because you see everything, and it’s very intuitive, just drag and drop. So from a high level, I think page builders are great for anyone who wants to be able to build custom websites and have a lot of flexibility to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as far as from a WooCommerce perspective, I think it works great. It’s just a perfect pairing, especially with Beaver Builder because WooCommerce out of the box is just a great solution for anyone who wants to create an e-commerce website with WordPress. Out of the box, you can have your shop, your cart, your checkout page, your product pages—those are all going to work out of the box. But what Beaver Builder and other page builders do is take it to the next level, where you can create custom layouts for your shop, custom layouts for your product page, your checkout page, your cart page. So all those shopping cart experiences can now be customized to match your brand and be consistent throughout your entire website. So that’s why I really like page builders with WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Nice. Excellent answer. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />It was really good. It was like all the questions that I wanted to ask as a follow-up were answered already. He’s good. I can see your podcast experience background. Maybe you can go into another thing, like an additional plugin that can help enhance all of these Beaver Builder features?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Well, thank you for leading with that question or the follow-up question, because Beaver Themer is an add-on product that we have that actually allows you to create all those custom layouts with WooCommerce and Beaver Builder. The good news is—and I was actually going to tell you this later in the podcast—we are going to be including Beaver Themer in all of our pricing packages soon. So now people can get the power of Beaver Builder, Beaver Themer, and if they want to create WooCommerce websites, it’s all going to be in a nice package for you. You can use it and be able to create it. We also have a free video tutorial course on how to create e-commerce websites using all of our products with WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Nice. When you said &#8220;The Power of Beaver Builder,&#8221; there was like a He-Man, &#8220;The Power of Beaver Builder.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Well, Brent, our design lead, always likes to create these themed beavers, especially during Halloween. So I might have to give him that idea, say, “Hey, maybe this year we could do like a Thor Beaver.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yes, there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />We’re even trying to get him to do a Batman Beaver, but he hasn’t gotten around to that yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Batman… a lot of alliteration going on there. Batman, Beaver Builder. Oh, very cool. Alright, so from a high level, there’s the customization that a page builder can bring you. What challenges might someone face—and this may be if you have any case studies or people that you’re thinking of—what type of challenges can someone run into as they’re building out their e-commerce site using Beaver Builder and WooCommerce? Are there things that you’ve seen, like, “Hey, these are the things you need to avoid,” or “You’re using Beaver Builder wrong”? Anything that you’ve seen that might be some of the challenges?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Well, I think when anyone is using any kind of new tool or software, there’s always going to be some kind of learning curve. But I think what people can find confidence in using WooCommerce and Beaver Builder is that both of those products have been around for a very long time. Beaver Builder’s been around for over 10 years, so the product is very stable, very mature, and it’s not going to go anywhere. The same thing with WooCommerce. WooCommerce has been around since, I mean, probably since WordPress started back in 2009 or so. They’re very reliable. The good news is if you do have any questions, there are so many video tutorials, so many courses, so many YouTube videos about both of these products that you’re going to be able to find any answer to any question you might have. Yeah, there’s a learning curve, and you might run into some roadblocks, but you can simply Google</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and find the answer to whatever roadblock you have while you’re creating your e-commerce site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Do you think there’s ever a case—or maybe you’ve seen an example—where a page builder was maybe not the right choice? Is there ever a situation like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah, I think if someone’s looking to create a basic online store and they already have a WordPress theme that they just really love and want to use, then that might be a good fit for them. They might say, “Hey, I already have a theme I like, or I have an existing site, and I just want to be able to plug in an e-commerce platform to add some products.” Then that’s perfect for them. They can install WooCommerce, use the default styles and settings, and they’re off and running with creating their e-commerce site. They don’t have to start over with a new page builder or a new website. So if they already have a preexisting site, or they just want to build something very simple, or they want to use a very specific theme, then maybe a page builder is not the right fit for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Got it. Sometimes when you run into the hardcore WordPress person who wrote the code themselves, I have seen this thing where page builders get a bad reputation, like “You don’t want to use a page builder.” What is the source of that angst that you may have seen out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Well, just seeing how WordPress has evolved over the years, I think, like you said, some of those hardcore WordPress users may have been the people who were there from the very beginning and liked to hand-code WordPress themes and their websites. So maybe they feel like, “Hey, a page builder kind of takes away the fun of hand-coding things the way they’re used to.” So they might not have completely adopted the idea of a page builder, but I think if they’re open to exploring it, they’ll find that, man, it really speeds up their development time—the time it takes to build websites—and they still have the flexibility to add code if they want to. So that’s one of the nice things about Beaver Builder. It’s pretty much a no-code type of product, but it does allow you to custom code, add your own HTML, CSS, JavaScript, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can do customization if you like to, but if you want to use a product out of the box without coding, you can. The other thing I will say is that there’s a lot of misconception when it comes to using page builders. People say, “Oh, it impacts speed or performance.” But there have been so many case studies that have been written online about people doing performance speed tests with page builders, including Beaver Builder, that have proven that page builders are actually very fast and are not the main cause of slow performance. When building a WordPress website, there are just so many factors that could impact speed, like slow web hosting services, if someone installs too many plugins, if people upload image files that are too large and haven’t been compressed, or if they’re not using other speed technology like caching tools and CDNs. I mean, there are so many other factors when it comes to speed and performance that I think people are being narrow-minded if they’re thinking that it’s just a page builder that’s slowing down their website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Have you found that some of those hardcore WordPress users who like to do everything themselves from coding everything start to see the beauty of a page builder? And what was it, maybe, that ended up changing their minds?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah, I mean, we get testimonials and feedback reviews all the time from people who say the exact same thing—you know, they had that aha moment where they said, “I have been a diehard non-page builder person for many years. I’ve been hand-coding everything myself, and I’ve finally tried out Beaver Builder or other page builders, and wow, I’m blown away. This is amazing. I’ll never go back to hand-coding everything myself.” And that’s just a fun turnaround story that we love to hear because I don’t think people have to necessarily choose one way or the other. They can actually have a hybrid of both. You can still use page builders and can still custom code on page builders. So I don’t think people have to plant their flag and say, “I only choose one side or the other.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />I love how you go through testimonials and get to know your customers. Beaver Builder has an incredible community. You have a very active Slack, with a lot of people in there talking about Beaver Builder. I’m curious, is there anyone who stands out who used Beaver Builder in a surprising way? There’s this idea I have that you make a tool, and someone uses your tool in a way that the creator wasn’t expecting or beyond the general idea. Has anybody surprised you, like “Wow, you made that with Beaver Builder”? Anything that stands out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Wow, there have been so many great websites and examples to choose from. It’s kind of hard to pick, but what recently surprised me was that there have been a lot of college websites created using Beaver Builder—really very recognized institutions. If you Google &#8220;College Beaver Builder College Websites,&#8221; we wrote a blog post about, I think it was, 13 colleges that created their websites using Beaver Builder. I’m just going to name off a few examples, like Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, USC, University of Florida, UC— I mean, the list goes on. These are all really prominent schools. The nice thing is these colleges are actually teaching these students how to build websites using Beaver Builder. And I’ll give another example that I was recently a part of, which was 48in48—I’m not sure if you guys have heard of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a nonprofit organization that helps build websites for organizations that need websites. Basically, they ask for volunteers to build 48 free websites for organizations that need them, and they build them in 48 hours or less, and they’re all using Beaver Builder to create these websites. I got to be part of the judging panel to select the top three. It’s just fun. It’s just some recognition. But I was amazed to see some of these websites that are created—I mean, full five to ten-page websites for these organizations. And I was very impressed by the quality of work that was done. So it was cool just to see people using Beaver Builder in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />That is so cool. I’m Googling 48in48 right now, and it makes me want to try it because I’ve just been trying to do a WooCommerce site on the side a couple of hours here and there. Now I’m like, “Alright, I’m going to go home—I’m at home—after this call. I’m going to go get Beaver Builder, sign up for it, and make 48 versions of it.” This is the coolest thing. I got goosebumps when you were telling me about this. This is really cool; it should get more attention. I like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah, we’re definitely trying to spread the word too. It’s just a great cause, and they’re always looking for volunteers. So if you want to help build websites or have any marketing skills that you want to volunteer, they’d be willing to have you help them. They always host this. I think every quarter, there’s a new event, so it’s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I just want to quickly circle back to the college websites. I’m also looking at that blog post right now that shows all of the images of it. So would you say—is there a niche or some type of topic that most Beaver Builder users tend to use it for, or does it kind of cover all different types of sites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />We’ve seen it all. We’ve seen it all. I mean, obviously we’ve seen e-commerce sites with WooCommerce. We have college websites; we have blogs. I think Robbie even said there was a NASA website that was using Beaver Builder. I mean, there are just some really cool examples of websites. People build directory websites, membership sites. What else is there? Yeah, I’ve definitely seen a variety, even just simple landing pages. There are so many use cases, and it’s really neat to see a lot of people that use it. I mean, there have been over a million websites built with Beaver Builder, so there’s probably everything you can imagine that’s been built with Beaver Builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s amazing. A million! There are a number of brands in WordPress that have a following, and I would say Beaver Builder is one of them. Sometimes there’s this tongue-in-cheek idea of your company needing fans and raving fans and how to get them. I would say that Beaver Builder actually does have fans, and it is exciting to see that. And I think your commitment to some of these projects where, “Hey, we’re going to give back; we’re going to do this 48in48,” things like that are spectacular. Alright, shifting gears a little bit, because Bob keeps bugging Emma and me that we’ve got to get our numbers up. SEO for this podcast—Bob keeps bugging us, so I’ve got to use the word AI a few more times, apparently. I’m kidding; Bob doesn’t say that. But that is one of the transformational things of technology in this industry. Nothing is going to be left untouched by AI in some way. I’m curious if Beaver Builder has any plans if anything’s happening in that area. Yeah. What’s your take on page builders and how page builders will relate to AI now and going forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is definitely moving very fast, I will say. And it’s exciting. It’s like the internet before the internet became what it is today, and I think that’s why people are so excited. There’s this new technology; they’re all trying to figure out how to apply it to their business, and the potential is limitless. The evolution in the last year or two has just been mind-boggling. Every time there’s a new announcement from OpenAI or Google or Facebook about something using AI, I’m just like, “Wow, it’s amazing.” So anyways, as far as when it comes to building websites, I’ve already seen a lot of technology and products and software that have been created to help web creators build websites using AI. For example, I’ve seen AI that can help create sitemaps. Obviously, they can write content, create stock images, spin up layouts, provide brand colors, and create logos for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of these are separate products, and I think where page builder companies will evolve to is they’ll find ways to integrate some of these special features or product capabilities into the page builder, which will eventually give someone more of an all-in-one solution for their customers. So that’s something that we’ve been exploring for our product as well. It’s like, “Okay, we want to continue to evolve our product. We want to give value to our customers, but we also don’t want to…” A lot of big concerns for page builders are that people say, “Oh, we don’t want page builders to have too much bloat.” So there’s a balancing act. We want to add more features, but it’s still got to be lightweight. It’s still got to not impact performance. We want to give all these AI integrations, but is it necessary? Are there other products or tools that are already doing it better that people can just rely on versus us trying to give a different version of it? So there’s definitely a lot of discussion on where AI fits into our business model. But yeah, it’s definitely something that we’re keeping a pulse on, and it’ll be interesting to see how we find ways to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Very cool. Thank you. That’s a very nice segue into whether there are any sneak peeks or exciting things happening that you can let us know about over at Beaver Builder. Maybe AI-related, but maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah, we actually have a lot of projects in development. We used to be, I guess, a little bit behind closed doors. A lot of times, we didn’t want the secret to come out too early, but now we’re trying to be more transparent, more open about what projects we’re working on. Justin Busa, the co-founder of Beaver Builder, actually wrote two blog posts recently about upcoming features and product development that they’re working on, and we’ve actually published them. We shared them, and if you check out those blog posts, we have screenshots, video clips, and examples of what that new technology is going to look like. And what we found is that being more transparent and letting people know what’s coming ahead has actually been a good thing. It’s created a lot of buzz; people are really excited about it. It’s something for people to look forward to. And it just shows that we’re continuing to grow. We’re definitely not stagnant. We’re continuing to add more to our product, continue to improve our product for our customers, and we’re listening to their feedback because a lot of the ideas that we’re implementing came from their feedback and their suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Nice. I love to hear stuff like that—giving clients exactly what they want and a solution to their problems. Actually, those are Adam’s words. I think he drops that at least once in every podcast, but I got him this time. Here you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Alright, so the name of this podcast is <em>Woo Biz Chat.</em> So, business—a lot of people listening to this have a business in WordPress and WooCommerce. Recently, you all made the decision to update pricing. Pricing is one of those topics that business owners in WordPress, and really in most any business, struggle with. How do we price this product? What are the repercussions of pricing? We know why we change pricing—it’s for profit and different reasons—but I recognize that. If you could maybe take us back behind the curtain a little bit and share with us—so Beaver Builder has updated its pricing. Can you walk us through the thought process, the steps you took to get to where you are today, and some of the things that might’ve made you nervous and how you decided to go forward? I’d love to just hear your thinking on pricing and price changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah, this is actually a really good discussion because we just published a blog post last week announcing our upcoming pricing changes that are going to happen in September. Now, before I even dive into that, I just want to let you know that if any existing Beaver Builder customers have a subscription, this does not impact them in any way. Their subscription, their plans, will all remain the same. They do not have to worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, that’s a choice right there. That’s part of a philosophy—is that we’re going to grandfather people, and we’re going to keep the people who are on our current plan the same. Okay, this is interesting. Yeah, I want to hear more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yeah. So Beaver Builder hasn’t changed its pricing for over 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Oh, wow. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />And of course, over those 10 years, the costs of things have gone up and have changed. But we struggled with changing our pricing because we care about our customers and we didn’t want to interrupt their current pricing models at any time. And so, when we did go through this process, we always thought of them first. These are our legacy customers. Some of these customers have been around for 5, 7, 8, 10 years, and we really wanted to, I guess, reward them for being loyal to us by not interrupting their pricing. We’re going to keep it all the same. So that was number one. It was rule number one—we do not mess with legacy customers’ pricing subscriptions. These changes are only impacting new customers. But we also didn’t want to go with the “Hey, we’re just going to raise prices to raise prices.” That just doesn’t feel good either. We’re really about the people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we said, “How can we add more value to our new customer base?” And one of the pieces of feedback that we got over the years was, “Hey, can you include Beaver Themer in all your pricing plans?” Now, when Beaver Themer came out in 2017, it was a new thing. Theme builders were not around. So Beaver Themer was one of the first to do it, or if not the first to do it. And so it was a new revolutionary product. So of course, we felt like, “Hey, this new product—we want to be able to provide it as an add-on subscription. If people want to use it, they can purchase it. If not, Beaver Builder as it is works great.” But over the years, as we got more competitors, our competitors started building theme builders into their pricing plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we said, “Okay, we want to be competitive with our competitors, so we’re going to include Beaver Themer in all our new pricing plans. We’re going to include the WordPress Beaver Builder theme in all of our pricing plans, and we’re going to change our lowest pricing package from $99 to $89.” So it lowers the barrier to entry for any new customer that just wants to build one website. They’ll get all of our products—the page builder, the theme, and Beaver Themer for only $89, which I think makes us very competitive. Then some of our other pricing plans, like our highest tier plan, our unlimited plan, is actually still the same. So not only did we lower our lowest price, we kept our highest price the same, and then our middle tiers are just slightly higher, but they include everything. They include Beaver Themer. So we really said, “Hey, how can we balance providing value and still make us competitive in the market?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the only main differentiator from our legacy users is that before, all of our plans in our legacy packages were unlimited. Now we have some site limitations. So our middle tier has a 50-site limit, our highest tier is unlimited, and our lowest tier is one site. But here’s the thing—we took it one step further. We didn’t just throw out any random number. We did a lot of digging into our analytics and did a case study of all of our customers out there—how many sites each subscription had, how many websites they built, and all these things in different pricing packages. We ran the numbers and said, “Okay, if we were to make this change, would it drastically impact our customers or any of our new customers?” And the answer is no. So we found a really nice balance where it’s like, we’re going to give you more value, and yeah, we’re going to give you slight limitations, but 90% of you are not even going to be impacted even if you change to the new plans. But if you stay with the old ones, you’re still going to be okay. It was a very well-thought-out process. I’m very proud of the team. It took us months to really come to where we are today. Even then, before pulling the trigger, we announced it to our Facebook group just to get some initial feedback to see if anyone brought up any things that we didn’t think of that we might need to adjust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, it’s been really well-received, so we’re very excited to push it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Nice. Congratulations on that. It sounds like it was something that you had to think through a lot. There were a lot of questions on, “Are we doing this the right way?” And it wasn’t just, “We need more money—raise prices.” It was done the Beaver Builder way, where you guys think through things and care a lot about your community. So well done there. But you say it’s not actually until September that this is going live?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Yes. Yeah. September, I believe it’s September 10th or 11th, somewhere around that range, is when we’re going live. And yeah, I will definitely say that we really wanted to focus on our customers, our community, and we did not want to upset them in any way. And that’s the one thing we definitely led with—this new plan does not impact you if you’re not changing your subscription. Legacy users, you’re still good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />There you go. So if you are listening to this podcast before September 10th, hurry up and go get your— but if you’re already a Beaver Builder user, you’re fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />But that’s actually great advice for all the listeners out there who have pricing plans on their sites—the thought process and all of the data analysis that you guys put into deciding when to do the change and how to do the change and what the price is like. That’s something that we hopefully can adapt into our own business models, however big or small your personal Woo business is. But that leads me into another question. Let’s say somebody jumps on this before the pricing change or after—it doesn’t matter—and they’re considering trying out Beaver Builder. Maybe they’re a first-timer for building a site in general. What kind of things should they focus on to get the most out of this tool? Is there a right or wrong way to build a website? Is there a logical way? It can be maybe something you recommend from experience, but yeah, what would be something that you would advise to someone using it for the first time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Well, if you’re interested in Beaver Builder, I would say there are a couple of opportunities to try it for free. Number one, we have Beaver Builder Lite, which is our free version. We’ve added some more to it, by the way, recently. And there’s also a free live demo on our website where you can actually click, and it’ll spin up a demo website, and you can literally drag and drop the modules and see how it works. So there are definitely some free versions that you can use to try it before you buy it. The other thing is we have free courses, as I mentioned, not only published on our YouTube channel, but they’re also available on our website. We don’t try to sell you anything. We just have you log in, and you can watch the video tutorials. You can watch video tutorials on how to use the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We even have a course that walks you from beginning to end on how to build a website, and you watch—we call it Follow Along—where you just follow us building the website, and we give you all the design files. That’s another way to do it as well. And gosh, like I said, there are just so many resources out there. There was a gentleman named Joshua Long—I’m just going to give him a shout-out. He just created a course recently on webdesigntrainer.com, where it’s a beginning-to-end, soup-to-nuts course on how to build a website using Beaver Builder. It’s very well created. I want to give him a shout-out. Also, WP101 has created a course on how to use basic WordPress. Their video tutorials are great, but they also have some course content regarding Beaver Builder. So yeah, there are a lot of different ways to learn about Beaver Builder, learn about WordPress, and learn how to use WooCommerce too. So hopefully, don’t be scared—just jump in, take it a little bit at a time, day by day, and you’ll be surprised at what you can create in a couple of days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, I was very impressed. I Googled WooCommerce and Beaver Builder, and Will Morris wrote a really in-depth article—just step-by-step—on how to build a WooCommerce site using Beaver Builder. And it is just a very well-done tutorial with videos. I think that type of attention to detail is one of the reasons why Beaver Builder is so popular. I think Elementor—and no shade to them at all, they’re great people over there—but one thing about Beaver Builder is that it feels to me like it’s the page builder for the people who know… just, it kind of has that feeling to me. And one thing I liked is that in that article, someone asked a question, and you were the first person to answer it. There was another one back in 2021. This article has been updated. And so you personally hopped in and answered a question. I think that just goes to who Beaver Builder is and what you guys really stand for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Thank you. Yeah, we’re definitely for the people. We try to be personable. And actually, we’re going to be at WordCamp US. So if you are in Portland this year, feel free to say hi to us. The founders are going to be there—Billy, Robbie, Justin, and I. So yeah, make sure you come and say hi. We’ll have a booth out there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Very cool. Yeah, I was just going to ask—so if anybody wants to get to know Beaver Builder, WordCamp US is where you should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah. Hopefully with a beaver holding a Thor hammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />I have high expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />But yeah, WordCamp US is just around the corner, so if you have more personal questions to ask Anthony or his colleagues, go find him at his booth, wherever that may be in the large conference hall. But is there maybe something that we didn’t ask you that you wanted to talk about related to Beaver Builder, WordPress, or a Woo site? Or it can be completely unrelated as well. We’re always down with that. Maybe something we forgot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony:<br />Well, I guess I’ll just leave with this. One of the great things about WordPress I’ve found is the community. Whatever product or products you use within WordPress, I think we all just look at it as a big ecosystem. We’re all one big family, especially when you notice it when we go to WordCamps, the WordPress meetups, local meetups, and of course the big conferences—WordCamp US, WordCamp Europe, Asia, etc. There’s just this really amazing community where we’re all just friends, and we all geek out about the same thing. It’s just fun to be able to hang out with like-minded people. So I would say if you haven’t gone to one of these live events, please do. It’s a lot of fun, and a lot of people put a lot of work into hosting these events. So make a trip, and hopefully, we’ll meet you all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Fantastic. Well, Anthony, thank you so much for supporting the WordPress community by attending these events. And again, yeah, stop by and meet Anthony and the good people of Beaver Builder at a WordCamp near you. Thank you for this time. This has been another episode of <em>Biz Chat.</em> You can find us wherever you find a podcast. Please share this podcast with people that you care about. If you don’t care about them, don’t share it with them. But if you do care about people, you should share this podcast because you’ll get to meet amazing people like Anthony and learn about the companies in WordPress that are doing the work, such as Beaver Builder. And with that, thank you so much. I hope you guys have a great rest of your day.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <em><strong>Woo BizChat</strong></em>, hosts <strong>Emma Young</strong> and <strong>Adam Weeks</strong> chat with <strong>Anthony Tran, Marketing Director of Beaver Builder</strong>, to explore the intersection of WooCommerce and page builders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony shares his journey from a WordPress web design agency owner to leading the marketing efforts at one of the most popular page builders in the WordPress ecosystem.

This launch coincides with the first day of WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2018, Do the Woo has evolved through continuously, growing both in content and community engagement. The decision to move Do the Woo to its own site in late 2022 was the first major step for the future. As we entered 2023, our mission began to extend beyond WooCommerce to encompass the broader WordPress ecosystem. The idea was simple: elevate voices and create a podcast by the community, for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2023, planning for the new started and in October, we solidified our efforts, with the goal of showcasing the diverse range of the Do the Woo podcast channel with our shows. With significant support from WordPress.com, this vision became a reality, culminating in a redesigned site that went live in March.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, we start our prelaunch. The official launch will be on June 13, 2024, when we will proudly unveil the fully developed Do the Woo 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features of Do the Woo 4.0</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Podcast Lineup:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the official launch, we now have a total of <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/our-shows/\">12 shows</a> and <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/about-the-woocommerce-builder-community/\">26 hosts</a>, including our latest addition focused on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/podcasts/scaling-enterprise-wordpress-and-open-source-software/\">enterprise WordPress and open-source software (OSS)</a>. <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/our-shows/\">Each show has its own dedicated page</a>, allowing listeners to learn about the series, explore past episodes, and subscribe to their favorite content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top priority was to provide an easy way for listeners to subscribe to the shows they want.

Understanding the &#8220;why&#8221; will guide your actions and decisions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify your tribe:</strong> Find the communities or groups where your target audience is active and engage with them. Building relationships within these communities can provide invaluable support and opportunities for collaboration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be bold and persistent:</strong> Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to potential partners or event organizers. Even if you receive a &#8220;no&#8221; initially, don&#8217;t be discouraged. Seek constructive feedback and consider alternative approaches for future endeavors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Develop your expertise:</strong> Continuously work on improving and sharing your knowledge and expertise. Consider giving talks at local meetups or WordCamps to establish yourself as an industry expert.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practice public speaking:</strong> Engage in activities like Toastmasters to improve your public speaking skills. Confidence in presenting your ideas is crucial for effective communication and networking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embrace confidence:</strong> Confidence doesn&#8217;t come from external validation. You have to believe in yourself and your capabilities. Take the initiative and recognize your own potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid hard-selling tactics:</strong> When participating in events or engaging with potential customers, focus on building relationships rather than pushing sales. Provide value and focus on becoming a trusted resource for your audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep track of data and feedback:</strong> Gather data and feedback from your PR activities to assess what is working and what needs improvement. Data points, whether positive or negative, provide insights for refining your PR strategies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engage in the margin:</strong> Allocate resources and opportunities for creative marketing initiatives. Having some margin allows you to experiment with brand-building activities and sustain long-term growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilize WordCamps as relationship building:</strong> Attend and sponsor WordCamps with the intention of building relationships rather than solely emphasizing direct sales. Use these events to connect with the WordPress community and establish your brand identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t wait for confidence:</strong> Confidence is an internal decision. Don&#8217;t wait for external validation or a sudden surge of belief in your abilities. Take charge of your confidence and trust in your potential to make things happen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek encouragement within:</strong> Ultimately, the motivation and encouragement you need comes from within. Don&#8217;t rely solely on external sources for validation. Embrace self-encouragement and belief in your journey.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen to the full episode here: <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/adding-public-relations-to-your-wordpress-or-woo-biz-stack/\">Adding Public Relations to Your WordPress or Woo Biz Stack</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Do The Woo Community: 10 Ways to Boost Your WordPress Affiliate Program\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6726\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/10-ways-to-boost-your-wordpress-affiliate-program/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3224:\"<p>Creating and running an affiliate program for your WordPress products or services can be overwhelming and challenging. Alex Standiford is asking everyone to rethink affiliate programs. Here are 10 ideas that may spark something new in your affiliate program.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consider Diverse Performance-Based Programs</strong>: Look beyond traditional affiliate models and consider partnerships that offer payouts based on specific performance metrics, such as driving traffic, customer satisfaction, or content engagement, in addition to sales.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on Quality Over Quantity</strong>: Rather than targeting a large number of affiliates, aim to work closely with a smaller group of committed affiliates who are aligned with your brand and have the potential for significant conversions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Develop Personalized Partnerships</strong>: Foster stronger relationships with affiliates by providing personalized support, workflow insights, and one-on-one consultations to maximize their success.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Explore Profit Margin-based Payouts</strong>: Determine payout percentages based on your profit margins, ensuring that the compensation aligns with the value brought in by affiliates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Emphasize Collaboration Among Affiliates</strong>: Allow for multiple affiliates to earn credit for the same sale, encouraging collaboration and teamwork among the affiliates rather than fostering competition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Evaluate the Long-term Commitment of Affiliates</strong>: Understand the level of commitment required for your products or services, especially for items with significant user loyalty, such as recurring payment services, and consider tailored affiliate approaches for each category.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid Over-reliance on Volume-based Traffic</strong>: Challenge the effectiveness of purely volume-based traffic and explore more nuanced and sustainable strategies to create a more targeted and engaged audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Encourage Allyship and Teamwork Among Affiliates</strong>: Foster an environment where affiliates can work together as allies, leveraging each other&#8217;s strengths to attract and convert traffic, encouraging specialized roles and collaboration for improved performance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider Tailored Affiliate Programs</strong>: Explore the possibility of customizing affiliate programs to match specific niches, addressing the limitations of generic affiliate approaches and contributing to improved partnership outcomes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prioritize In-depth Support and Education</strong>: Provide comprehensive resources, insights, and dedicated support to affiliates, setting up workflows to guide them through effective strategies and enable overall success.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn about Alex&#8217;s WordPress plugin <strong><a href=\"https://www.sirenaffiliates.com/\">SirenAffilates.com</a></strong> and / or listen to the full episode on Do the Woo: <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/reimagining-affiliate-programs-for-your-woo-biz-with-alex-standiford/\"><strong>Reimagining Affiliate Programs for Your Woo Biz with Alex Standiford</strong></a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: 12 Email Marketing Tips for WooCommerce and WordPress Businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6246\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/12-email-marketing-tips-for-woocommerce-and-wordpress-businesses/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6257:\"<p>In a podcast episode of <em><strong>Woo BizChat </strong></em>we had email marketing expert Greg Zakowicz from Omnisend chatting with Emma and Adam. Although it&#8217;s recommended that you listen to the full episode, <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/email-marketing-tips-for-woo-and-wordpress-businesses/\">Email Marketing for Woo and WordPress Builders and Businesses with Greg Zakowicz</a></strong> , here are 12 tips to help with your WordPress or WooCommerce business, whether you create products or provide services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-embrace-automation\">Embrace Automation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg emphasizes the effectiveness of automated emails, revealing that 41% of all email marketing orders sent by Omnisend customers came from automated messages. Automation allows you to send targeted and relevant messages based on the user&#8217;s behavior, making it a powerful tool for increasing engagement and conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-on-high-intent-automated-messages\">Focus on High-Intent Automated Messages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg highlights specific automated messages that drive results, including welcome messages, browse abandonment, and cart abandonment emails. These messages are high-intent and directly tied to user behavior, making them more likely to lead to conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-utilize-social-proof-in-subject-lines\">Utilize Social Proof in Subject Lines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg suggests that subject lines featuring social proof, such as top-rated products or five-star reviews, can capture attention. Incorporating elements that highlight the quality and popularity of your products or services can make your emails more appealing to recipients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-experiment-with-emojis-in-subject-lines\">Experiment with Emojis in Subject Lines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not being a new concept, Greg emphasizes the continued effectiveness of using emojis in subject lines. Emojis can help break up the visual monotony, especially on mobile devices, making your emails stand out in crowded inboxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-optimize-for-mobile-and-visual-appeal\">Optimize for Mobile and Visual Appeal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg discusses the importance of visual elements, white space, and breaking up text to make emails visually appealing. Since many users access emails on their mobile devices, optimizing for mobile responsiveness and creating visually engaging content can enhance the overall user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-clean-inactive-contacts-regularly\">Clean Inactive Contacts Regularly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg emphasizes the importance of cleaning inactive contacts from your email list to maintain deliverability and engagement rates. Sending emails to inactive contacts can negatively impact your sender reputation and result in lower inbox placement. Regularly clean your list, preferably twice a year, to remove subscribers who haven&#8217;t engaged in a significant period.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-understand-and-monitor-email-deliverability-requirements\">Understand and Monitor Email Deliverability Requirements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay informed about email deliverability requirements, such as authentication protocols like DKIM, DMARC, and SPF. Greg mentions that Google and Yahoo have implemented new deliverability requirements, and compliance with these standards is crucial for proving your legitimacy as a sender and avoiding potential deliverability issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benchmark-against-yourself-not-just-industry-averages\">Benchmark Against Yourself, Not Just Industry Averages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While industry benchmarks can provide useful insights, Greg advises marketers to primarily benchmark against their own performance. Focus on improving your open rates and click-through rates over time rather than comparing yourself solely to industry averages, as different list-cleaning practices can significantly impact these benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-leverage-competitive-differentiators-in-email-templates\">Leverage Competitive Differentiators in Email Templates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating email templates, highlight competitive differentiators such as free shipping, fast delivery, and customer service policies. Templatize this information to make it highly visible in your emails, catering to the specific intent of users who are looking for such value propositions when deciding whether to engage with your email content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-templatize-social-proof-and-value-propositions\">Templatize Social Proof and Value Propositions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporate social proof, customer testimonials, and value propositions into your email templates. Whether it&#8217;s showcasing five-star reviews, testimonials about great customer service, or emphasizing hassle-free returns, templatizing this content can build confidence and address potential obstacles to conversion, ultimately increasing click-through rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-implement-automated-retargeting-sequences\">Implement Automated Retargeting Sequences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg emphasizes the importance of setting up automated retargeting sequences based on user behavior. Whether it&#8217;s a browse abandonment or cart abandonment, these automated sequences can significantly improve the chances of reengaging with users who have shown interest in your products. By strategically utilizing automation, you can &#8220;feed the wolf&#8221; over time, increasing the likelihood of recapturing customers at a lower cost compared to other retargeting methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-use-ai-tools-for-subject-line-generation\">Use AI Tools for Subject Line Generation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg recommends using AI tools, such as the subject line generator provided by Omnisend, to overcome creative blocks when crafting email subject lines. AI-powered tools can offer a fresh perspective and propose creative subject lines that may not have been considered. This can be particularly useful in ensuring that your subject lines stand out and capture the attention of your audience, contributing to higher email open rates</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Do The Woo Community: Learn Marketing Deeply with Your WordPress Products\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6241\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/wordpress-product-marketing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2248:\"<p>In a recent Emerging Tech episode David Lockie had the chance to talk about a lot of WordPress with Noel Tock plus catch up on what he is doing. This is the final thought coming from Noel, and I would recommend checking out the entire conversation: <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/learn-wordpress-product-marketing-deeply/\"><strong>Learn WordPress Product Marketing Deeply with Noel Tock</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-on-noel-s-mind\">On Noel&#8217;s Mind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say what I talked about now is probably the thing that bugs me the most or lives rent free in my mind is that amazing effort and energy that everyone puts into WordPress, but then is trying to fit through a pipe that&#8217;s way too small in terms of product marketing is never really displayed in its full glory to the rest of the market in a very specialized way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a struggle to you start thinking, are you delusional because you&#8217;re talking to an enterprise client when they say WordPress doesn&#8217;t do this, doesn&#8217;t do that. And you&#8217;re sitting there thinking, am I just like a WordPress advocate or do I actually know what I&#8217;m talking about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think in many ways, when Matt, years ago, 2015, what was it 2015 when he said learn JavaScript deeply, I think now it&#8217;s learn marketing deeply. That&#8217;s what I think should be WordPress&#8217;s mission for the next two years because we are in a time when we&#8217;ve gone boom bust and we have an opportunity to seize right now as companies are looking at down rounds and they&#8217;re laying off staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first places they cut is R&amp;D and innovation, and we have an opportunity to catch up on that ground. Not that we have to necessarily build a lot of stuff at all. I don&#8217;t even think we have to build that stuff, but I think we have to just do a much better job of product marketing at <strong>three, four or five levels of niches</strong>. And to me, it doesn&#8217;t mean that those couple niches define what WordPress is. There are just merely abstractions and narratives that sit on top of the WordPress we know today.

For contributors keeping up all of these essential projects and in reality, are like saying &#8220;Hey, y&#8217;all pay up for what I&#8217;m doing for you here for free.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost opened it up with this thought it it went further into who should really be stepping up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-in-a-perfect-world\">In a perfect world&#8230;.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost: But it also opens up a wider discussion about how do we support the tools that we use that are not like the tools that end users may be using, but the tools that we use to build those. It&#8217;s this whole ecosystem. And are we even aware of the fact that we&#8217;re using this code? Well, I think it&#8217;s a problematic thing, and I have my opinions on how we should solve this in an ideal world. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not the one who gets to decide that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in my ideal world, we would have a WordPress app store where WordPress plugins, the plugin repository would not just be for free plugins, but would also be for commercial plugins. And we take a percentage of sales there and put that money to work on stuff like this and lots of other things. I think that would make WordPress better for everyone. We could how we want plugins to sell their things, and we couldn&#8217;t enforce all the proper legalities there that are needed, and we could fund the companies and the projects that we need that we all need to, well, to sustain our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-and-there-is-so-much-more\">And there is so much more&#8230;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that was the perfect world for Joost. But Tom and Joost went on to talk about other ways of funding these projects and who should be stepping up. Of course, it&#8217;s not even that simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/funding-wordpress-projects-with-tom-willmot-and-joost-de-valk/\"><strong>Listen to the full episode Funding WordPress Projects with Tom Willmot and Joost de Valk here.&nbsp;</strong></a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Do The Woo Community: Starter WooCommerce Performance Tips for Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6174\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/starter-woocommerce-performance-tips-for-developers/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10033:\"<p>In a <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\">Woo DevChat</a>, I asked <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabrinazeidan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACbwBtEBQRgcNmwLLij0zaBN7znv_qYfCuM\">Sabrina Zeidan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wputasic?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACQSmi8BUWyj0LAr-g2JbUQcu799ehldCdA\">Uros Tasic</a> to give their insights into WooCommerce performance. One suggestion that Sabrina made was that they come up a a few step for a developer who is not performance expert but they notice or they feel like you feel like the website is acting slow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s fronted or backend. It was fine a month ago and now it&#8217;s acting weirdly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-using-a-query-monitor\">Using a Query Monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I would recommend is so easy. So this is not a developer tool, but it&#8217;s easy if you can add a plugin that is a query monitor. It can show you if there is some error on the site or if there are some slow queries to the database. So again, I know that there are developers going to say you can see slow queries, MySQL queries on the server. So that is advanced thing, the simplest thing, add a plugin and track, not the best thing, but you can see there if there are some issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-checking-the-logs\">Checking the Logs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a query monitor doesn&#8217;t reveal anything or important, then I would suggest now depending on your hosting and server provider, you can check logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say for the people that are not experienced, there are two types of logs. One is the error log and another one is access log. So if you don&#8217;t know when something is happening or what kind of are pages causing it in access log, you can see that. For example, in the last hour you got 1000 views of specific page on the website that has a newsletter and some feed or something and then you can assume that something on that page is creating a problem and continue from there. In that case you can create test page with only one block or with only feed to see if that is going to behave slowly and then you can eliminate one by one. This is if the page is making a problem. Then you can see also if there is some current jobs or W-P-C-L-I commands and then you can address those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in multiple cases if you have a big database doing a backup, it can slow down the site because the database will be locked and then the site cannot do anything. So again, you can move backups, but you can see those details in the access login error log of the website. Again you cannot see everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-using-more-advanced-tools\">Using More Advanced Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to go more advanced and I want to be actively doing on performance, there are tools that I would recommend that you can use New Relic, you can use Xdebug or you can use Blackfire. All those three tools are testing your code performance. You can record the whole page and then it&#8217;ll tell you exactly how many queries, what function is called, how many times the function is called, which file is, and how it&#8217;s behaving in the background for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there you can then pick saying, okay, this plugin is taking five seconds to load on this specific page to I really need this plugin or can this be changed? Can I introduce some caching plugin, can I? But those are a little bit more advanced tools but I would spend some time to get familiar with those similar tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just once more, this is Blackfire, New Relic and Xdebug. Some of them are free, some of them have a paid plan. So again, you don&#8217;t need all three but you can start with at least one. And then again, if you want to test the front end and just the Google Page speed, you can use Lighthouse or Google speed may have some suggestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum it up, first one is query monitor, easy, and there are good things about it. It&#8217;s pretty user friendly. You can just see what&#8217;s happening and if something is red, you know that strong. So it&#8217;s easy to find the bottlenecks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one would be check the logs on the server, both access and error logs and then PHP errors or something like that.And the third one is use one of the tools like Blackfire, New Relic or Xdebug and again you&#8217;ll find issues with plugins but then this is awareness I&#8217;m talking about. But yes, what would your steps be?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sabrina-s-perspective-as-a-performance-engineer\">Sabrina&#8217;s perspective as a performance engineer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share the steps when I&#8217;m hired to work on a websites, but steps that someone who is not performance expert but just a developer can take to identify what&#8217;s happening and if something is happening because this is the beginning of the process. So let&#8217;s say you just notice something is off. I would recommend to start with narrowing down the problem if it might be overwhelming for the person who is not used to a lot of performance information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-google-search-console\">Google search console</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I would recommend to first identify if the problem exists and if so where it does exist. I would recommend to go first thing to Google search console and check your core web vitals data and see if there are any issues there. Google Search console is place where in page size there is a small thing where you have core web vitals assessment. This is real field data from your website, but it comes from the bigger source of information and the more detailed report can be found in Google search console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a tab there called core vitals. You can go there and check if your website is passing core vitals assessment. If the website is passing core web vitals assessment, especially on LCP and first input delay, which will soon be replaced with INP interactive to the next paint. So if it passing on this two, it means that real users don&#8217;t have problems with speed on your website on front end, but if at the same time you have the feeling that something is off, something is loading slowly, I would try to differentiate probably if it&#8217;s happening only when you locked in, if it&#8217;s happening for locked in users and it&#8217;s not happening for locked out users and then you will have the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not happening for locked out users, there are no issues with core web vitals, then this issue most likely will be connected with something on backend that is cached or mitigated by something on front end for locked off users. Okay, this is already a lot of information for us. We already know that we should be looking in the backend because it&#8217;s happening in the backend and from this point I would recommend install query, monitor and looking there. But again, when you install query monitor, there is a huge amount of information there. If you don&#8217;t know where you are looking at, it&#8217;s easy to get lost. And some websites have a lot of issues. This happens to my clients a lot. They see that the website have a lot of issues, there are errors, there are slow queries, there are a lot of sales and scripts loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many issues I would recommend to pinpoint what is the most easy thing to fix and the most easy things to fix are usually basic ones, First it&#8217;s PHP version. It would be so easy to, it&#8217;s really, really easy to fix. You just upgrade server to a higher PHP version test there. If all plugins play well with it, you keep it going.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-memory-limits\">Memory limits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the thing that is often overlooked, there is a theme that we have in WordPress that is called Ability memory limit and by default it&#8217;s set to 40 megabytes and I see a lot of cases when this default number hasn&#8217;t been changed. For years the site was surviving somehow, but now it&#8217;s not because 40 megabytes, it&#8217;s very, very low number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it happens often. I see that they are upgrading their hosting, they&#8217;re paying for say two gigabytes of RAM on their hosting, but there is a limit set in their WordPress to 40 gigabytes. So they never use what they&#8217;re paying for. By the way query monitor is showing that thing. So if memory limit is set to the default to 40 megabytes, you&#8217;ll see that in query monitor. That would be another very easiest thing to fix. This is something that you should be able to fix yourself and if after that the problem doesn&#8217;t disappear, that that is a sign there is a problem that this is a sign you should seek for help.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-misleading-object-caching\">Misleading object caching</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Object caching can be a very good idea and query monitor might be showing that as well. What it shows you sometimes can be misleading. In query monitor it says object caching plugin is not in use and it&#8217;s a little bit misleading because you should check numbers next to this line seeing so many hits and so many cached and if you have from 100%, you have 95% cashed, that&#8217;s fine. It means query caching is working. It&#8217;s just you&#8217;re not using the plugin to manage it, but it is working. There is nothing to worry about. So my recommendation would be try to figure out if it&#8217;s frontend or backend by going to core web vitals. Then going as locked in user and trying to figure out if it&#8217;s backend or frontend. If it&#8217;s backend, it&#8217;s still query monitor, look at query basic things like WP memory limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can listen to the entire episode <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\">WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Do The Woo Community: Navigating High-Traffic Events with WooCommerce as an Agency\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6082\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/navigating-high-traffic-events-with-woocommerce-as-an-agency/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4090:\"<p>Operating a large-scale e-commerce business is no small feat, but when Black Friday through Cyber Monday hits, the challenges intensify, making it a crucial period for businesses like Maksimer. From a <strong>conversation on Do the Woo&#8217;s DevChat</strong>, Nenad Conić talks with hosts Zach and Carl about the strategies and experiences shared by the team at Maksimer as they tackle the unique demands of Black Friday and maintain seamless operations during this high-stakes weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-preparing-for-a-high-traffic-event\">Preparing for a high-traffic event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nenad highlights the importance of a two-month preparation period leading up to leading up to an event like Black Friday. Proactive communication with clients becomes paramount during this time, aiming to collaboratively plan and optimize sales campaigns. Emphasis is placed on creating effective landing pages that showcase sale products, allowing targeted optimization without overhauling the entire site. The goal is to enhance the customer experience on specific pages crucial for sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-challenges-and-solutions\">Challenges and Solutions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite great planning, there are always last-minute changes from some clients, creating unforeseen challenges. Nenad acknowledges that while it&#8217;s challenging to prevent such changes entirely, early communication and preparation remain critical. To address unexpected surges in server resource usage they implement monitoring systems. These systems trigger alerts when server resources approach their limits, enabling quick intervention to prevent site crashes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-navigating-the-unknown\">Navigating the Unknown</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the conversation it turns  to the unpredictable nature of server warnings, comparing them to a tsunami warning with a narrow window for response. Despite the challenges, having different departments within the company, such as the growth department and eco managers, provides additional support. Eco managers work closely with clients, offering insights and suggestions for handling their websites during high-traffic events.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-entrepreneurial-mindset\">The Entrepreneurial Mindset</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>They talk about the unique mindset of e-commerce store owners, describing them as self-motivated individuals eager to explore new tools and strategies. The challenge lies in balancing their entrepreneurial spirit with practical considerations. The team at Maksimer often receives requests to implement new features, such as affiliate programs, based on success stories from other store owners. Adapting these requests to the specific e-commerce platform and ensuring compatibility becomes an integral part of the collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-partnerships\">Building Partnerships</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An important piece is the partnership dynamic between an agency and store owners in the e-commerce space. Unlike traditional marketing site builds, e-commerce clients actively engage throughout the entire process, understanding that their website directly influences their income stream. The agency&#8217;s role extends beyond building websites; they effectively control the client&#8217;s income funnel, requiring a collaborative and responsive approach to maintain client satisfaction, especially in crisis situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-traffic events in e-commerce demands a combination of meticulous planning, effective communication, and adaptability.

These entities work hand in hand, each playing a vital role in creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme and plugin providers, for instance, offer essential tools that enhance the functionality and aesthetic appeal of WordPress sites, ensuring users enjoy a seamless experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-dev-chat/\">Developers, on the other hand, bring in technical expertise</a>, customizing websites to meet specific business needs, while hosting providers offer the requisite infrastructure, ensuring websites are accessible, reliable, and fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-and-its-market-dominance\"><strong>WordPress and Its Market Dominance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An understanding of the WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem wouldn&#8217;t be complete without appreciating WordPress&#8217;s market dominance. WordPress holds sway over a significant portion of the CMS market, powering <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">over 40% of all websites</a> currently available on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The factors driving its widespread adoption are its flexibility, ease of use, and extensive customization possibilities. <strong>WordPress&#8217;s open-source nature</strong>, combined with its vast community of developers and theme and plugin providers, provides businesses with virtually unlimited potential for customizability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s this scalability and versatility that have contributed significantly to WordPress&#8217;s sustained market dominance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-woocommerce-and-its-place-in-ecommerce\"><strong>WooCommerce and Its Place in eCommerce</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce is a dynamic player in the global eCommerce market. It rides on WordPress&#8217;s success by providing an intuitive, flexible, and powerful ecommerce platform that businesses of all sizes can leverage to set up online stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of WooCommerce are immense. From its seamless integration with WordPress, ease of use, flexibility, and the availability of numerous themes and plugins, WooCommerce offers businesses a customizable platform for setting up online stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When stacked against other platforms like Shopify, Magento, and BigCommerce, WooCommerce shines for its affordability and adaptability. Shopify and BigCommerce are monthly subscription-based platforms, while Magento can be complex and may require expert developer knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the contrary, WooCommerce is free, open-source, and user-friendly, making it a viable contender in the eCommerce space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-identifying-opportunities-for-growth\"><strong>Identifying Opportunities for Growth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the dynamic WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem, businesses must continuously identify and seize growth opportunities. A successful scaling strategy involves playing to the platform&#8217;s strengths and seeing beyond immediate needs to include future prospects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are growth opportunities that businesses can use:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-expanding-product-offerings\"><strong>1. Expanding Product Offerings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In any business venture, innovation is key. To truly tap into the potential of WooCommerce and WordPress, consider expanding your product offerings. This could be done by developing new plugins or incorporating additional services that complement your current product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples could include tools that enhance website functionality, services geared towards improving the user-experience, or partnerships aimed at promoting your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-building-strong-partnerships\"><strong>2. Building Strong Partnerships</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind every successful business, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/the-enigma-of-wordpress-and-woocommerce-partnerships/\">network of strong partnership</a>s. In the WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem, fruitful connections can be forged with plugin and theme providers, WordPress agencies, and hosting providers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborating with these entities on various initiatives can lead to reciprocal benefits and expanded growth opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-focusing-on-customer-success-and-support\"><strong>3. Focusing on Customer Success and Support</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The backbone of every successful business is its loyal customers. By building a robust customer support system, you&#8217;ll foster trust, loyalty, and eventual advocacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritize customer success management, which involves understanding your customers&#8217; journey and providing the support they need at every step.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-investing-in-content-marketing-and-seo\"><strong>4. Investing in Content Marketing and SEO</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret sauce for <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/influencer-marketing/\">gaining visibility and attracting customers</a> lies in content marketing and SEO.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating valuable, engaging, and <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/future-seo-content-ai/\">SEO-friendly content</a> ensures your business&#8217; visibility to potential customers and argues for your credibility within your industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-adapting-to-industry-trends\"><strong>5. Adapting to Industry Trends</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s rapidly changing digital world, staying informed about industry trends and adapting your strategies accordingly, can be a game-changer for your business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular monitoring of industry best practices, competitor activity, and <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/tag/emerging-technologies/\">emerging technology</a> trends can keep you on your toes and ready to adapt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-measuring-the-success-of-growth-strategies\"><strong>Measuring the Success of Growth Strategies</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing growth strategies without a system to measure their success won&#8217;t yield the desired effect. Analytics play a vital role in gauging the effectiveness of strategies and indicate where improvements are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-metrics-to-nbsp-track\"><strong>Metrics to&nbsp; Track</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To quantify your strategy&#8217;s success, consider tracking metrics like customer acquisition costs, churn rate, and average revenue per user.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These metrics provide insight into how effectively your strategies are working, where improvements could be made, and whether you&#8217;re reaching your desired goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-adjusting-strategies-based-on-data\"><strong>Adjusting Strategies Based on Data</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is your best ally when it comes to steering the direction of your growth strategies. It adds objectivity to the process, helps you steer clear of bias-based decisions and allows for strategic pivots based on insights drawn from real-life performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuous analysis and refinement of your strategies based on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-custom-order-tables-databases-and-performance/\">performance data</a> will help ensure that your growth strategies remain effective and relevant in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\"><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress and WooCommerce platforms are excellent tools for online business growth. However, simply knowing how to use these tools isn&#8217;t enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly succeed, businesses must have a solid plan. This should involve identifying new opportunities, building partnerships, focusing on customer service, staying updated with industry trends, and making data-driven decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining these strategies ensure success not only today but also prepares businesses for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-5-background-color has-background has-medium-font-size\"><strong>This is a guest post from our sponsor and the team at <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/\">Dotstore</a></strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"Do The Woo Community: Documentation is a Gift to the WordPress Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6007\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/documentation-is-a-gift-to-the-wordpress-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1370:\"<p>While we we were recording an episode of <strong><em>The WordPress Way</em></strong> at Do the Woo about <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/importance-of-product-testing-in-wordpress/\"><strong>The Importance of Product Testing in WordPress</strong></a>, guest Brian Alexander did a quick note in the chat tool we use during a recording, simply saying, &#8220;Documentation is a gift to the community.&#8221; Host Abha Thakor asked him to elaborate on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Yeah, consider someone who is not as familiar with WordPress or is having a problem with their website or is a developer who&#8217;s just getting started. All of those different roles benefit from having strong updated documentation. Think of how many forum posts might not have been logged because it was clearly stated how to use a particular feature in the documentation or perhaps uncovering bugs as you said, because that&#8217;s all part of it. Validating your documentation in a way you&#8217;re testing what your assumptions are and if those assumptions are incorrect, then you&#8217;re assuming the wrong thing or there&#8217;s a bug in the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that definitely becomes a gift to the entire community as a resource that doesn&#8217;t require one-on-one time or tying up one person.

You talked about schema. What&#8217;s that pace of change like now compared to how it has been over the last say, 20 years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Alex replied.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say it seems that since September, Google have woken up to updating a lot more stuff. from what I heard, Google was busy with other things internally that that was prioritized over supporting schema within search console and different elements of it. But I saw when things like the FAQ and the event snippets were removed from the SERPs, there&#8217;s been a lot of testing over time of what different elements should be output in the search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the same time, you&#8217;ve got their own AI integrations with their own SERP. So there&#8217;s been a lot of changes, not only, I would say more clarification and expansion into what they&#8217;ve already been telling us the entire 20 years. So 20 years ago they had the webmaster guidelines, it was quite basic, right? But now it&#8217;s a whole documentation area of the site. everything&#8217;s been done.

So I did support for a long time before I hired somebody to help me with it, and now we&#8217;re kind of splitting the workload and I still go in there from time to time just to see what are the really technical tickets or if I know a customer, I will reply to them just to maintain that relationship or if I feel like I can get some more information out of the issue that the customer has or what they might want next for the plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll also jump in and reply. So I keep doing a lot of support and since I develop my own plugins, it&#8217;s always going to be the fastest. I can do probably 20 tickets in an hour and they will be finished too. There will be a reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-using-support-to-perfect-documentation\">Using support to perfect documentation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s really the best thing to do for me. But yeah, it takes a lot of time, so you want to have to put in that time. But other than that, what I also did is I keep perfecting documentation, so I keep going back to the same documentation. If a customer has a question that is in the documentation and they didn&#8217;t find a reply, I will rewrite it. I will find a different way to say the same thing. And now I&#8217;m also experimenting with AI just to see if it can help with lowering that burden on support and also just give a quicker answer to my customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-average-ticket-when-you-delegate-support-might-take-half-an-hour-to-do\">The average ticket when you delegate support might take half an hour to do</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie</strong>: It&#8217;s interesting what you say about being able to do 20 tickets an hour because that highlights the most difficult thing that I have found in outsourcing your support and getting help with it because I too, as the founder, very, very fast at responding to tickets at what I think is very high quality. I know the product so well, I know our documentation, I wrote it after all. And so I can provide good responses very quickly, but then as soon as you start hiring out people to do it, whether they&#8217;re in-house or not, you find that that&#8217;s not what you receive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, and I&#8217;ve talked to many other WordPress product companies, the average ticket when you delegate support might take half an hour to do. They&#8217;re not doing 20 tickets an hour or anything like that. And as a founder, that&#8217;s really frustrating because you don&#8217;t understand why they&#8217;re not as fast as you, but you kind of have to just learn to accept that it&#8217;s one of the inevitable consequences of growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, at Barn2, we handle 22,000 support tickets last year. So clearly I can&#8217;t do all the support myself, and I would love to, I really enjoy support, particularly pre-sales because it&#8217;s an excellent touchpoint with your customers where you can really learn their motivation, how they see your products, and constantly when I do step into support and talk to customers, I&#8217;m finding opportunities to improve the documentation, improve the products, improve our sales pages. I learned so much from doing the support, but it&#8217;s not realistic. And so you have to get help and as part of that, you just have to accept that nobody is as fast as you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-still-go-in-there-and-i-do-a-lot-of-support\">I still go in there and I do a lot of support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maarten</strong>: Yeah, and I was going to add that I fully agree with you there. It&#8217;s very frustrating in the beginning to find a support agent because you are used to your own speed of doing things, and it&#8217;s like you said, you have to come to terms with it. And for me, it took like six months where I was very frustrated with how things were going, and then I realized that it&#8217;s just all in my head and my expectations need to be different, and now everything&#8217;s going well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very happy with the support guide and it&#8217;s all known off my shoulders, so it&#8217;s perfect really. But I still go in there and I do a lot of support, but it&#8217;s on my agenda to lower my burden on support for this year because I&#8217;m doing too much and I&#8217;m spread a little bit too thin, especially if I&#8217;m developing new plugins.

Because of how PHP works. There might be some non-technical people who might not understand exactly how that model doesn&#8217;t work, and they might not be able to find time to read your research. But can you just give an overview of why that doesn&#8217;t,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens, I mean, I&#8217;ve seen the malware that&#8217;s done this, that&#8217;s like, oh, well, you can find everybody else&#8217;s malware, but you&#8217;re not going to find mine. And that hacker can modify those files. Can you explain why they can, why they get a site has an intrusion from, let&#8217;s say a SQL vulnerability, that SQL injection that does not have anything to do with anything happening in PHP, but they can still then get access to PHP files and modify them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-scanner-plugins-won-t-work\">Why scanner plugins won&#8217;t work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s start by at the point of through some means your site has been infected, so it doesn&#8217;t matter that infinite attack vectors, how that could have happened, but now your site has malware on it, and you also have a plugin that does malware scanning, maybe like using the WP chron periodically, or you can start it from the UI, whatever. But ultimately this scan, the malware scan runs in the same process, the PHP process and with the same privilege level as the malware. So the most simplest and the most blunt hit with the hammer approach, the malware could just simply disable or delete your security plugin from the file system. This will be like the easiest to understand the first time the malware runs, it just deletes your security plugin. That&#8217;s the easiest after there aren&#8217;t any scans, but obviously you as a site administrator would realize that at some point, yeah, maybe not immediately, but maybe you&#8217;ll realize eventually that your security plugin is gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />So what they do is then because they can read the source code of the plugin, they can see how it works, and since they&#8217;re operating at the same privilege level, they&#8217;re both running inside of WordPress in the PHP process that powers WordPress, they can then alter the malware scanner in a way that maybe imagine this. They&#8217;re very complex operations going on to determine if a file is malware or not, and then the actual malware modifies that final result. It is displayed to you in the UI and just says, yeah, you&#8217;re all clean. Pretty much that&#8217;s how it works. They make the malware scanner lie to you. They make the malware scanner tell you there&#8217;s no malware, but there actually is. And the way to do that depends on malware based on the malware scanner that you have. And obviously we didn&#8217;t disclose what we did there. We don&#8217;t want to make it easier for folks, but it&#8217;s pretty easy, to be honest, like 10 lines of quote maybe to do that. It&#8217;s not hard. So yeah, that&#8217;s the fundamental issue. The system that is potentially infected wants to monitor itself, and that doesn&#8217;t work. It has to be from somewhere higher up or someplace that is more privileged at the server level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-plugins-that-have-firewalls-associated-built-into-the-plugin\">Plugins that have firewalls associated built into the plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the firewall would be protection, not scanning. I mean, if you have hardware on your side, the firewall can be disabled in the very same manner. That&#8217;s also the, but at that point, you&#8217;re already infected. The firewall usually is there to prevent you from getting infected in the first place. There isn&#8217;t anything wrong in particular with plugin based firewalls. It&#8217;s more so that everything that you can do in a plugin with a firewall, you can do, for example, the Edge at CloudFlare or in the Nix firewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Yeah, just it&#8217;s heavy from a CIS admin perspective, especially in enterprise, right? We&#8217;re talking enterprise. So larger WooCommerce stores, larger sites, they need more PHP workers. They want their code to be more efficient so that the response time is faster and all those things. If every request has to be processed as a firewall request, it&#8217;s a lot of processing time dedicated to that. It&#8217;s not. Trivial in itself is a one serious reason to just not use super heavy security plugins like that is if they just do a lot and they put a lot of weight on your WordPress installation, which is a problem again for enterprise because they&#8217;re trying to be more performant, they&#8217;re trying to handle more sales, more everything, and you&#8217;re basically, it&#8217;s like having an ankle weight. You&#8217;re kind of dragging. Every request has this huge ankle weight that you&#8217;re dragging, and that serves not no purpose, but as we&#8217;re discussing the malware scanning doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s more like security theater, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />The malware scanning and some other things. Fundamentally, it&#8217;s impossible to perform that at the plugin level. And there are other things that are the same, but for example, the firewall, it is absolutely possible to write a secure firewall in a WebPress plugin. There&#8217;s nothing that makes it conceptually impossible, unlike the malware example. You can do that, whether the existing ones are secure, it&#8217;s a different topic, but it is theoretically possible. The thing is, it will not be performed because as Carl mentioned, at that point where the plugin based firewall runs, you already incur the majority of the cost of that request. You already went through the edge layer. Engine X ran, WordPress was booted, and then your firewall is hit. So it&#8217;s not performant. It&#8217;s possible to do it securely,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Or let&#8217;s go one step further to you&#8217;re trying to mitigate a DDoS. If your firewall&#8217;s, the actual PHP application, you ain&#8217;t mitigating anything, right? Your site&#8217;s blowing up either way. It&#8217;s all cool. You have a firewall, but you&#8217;re still getting hammered by hundreds of thousands of requests, your server&#8217;s not going to be able to handle it, and it&#8217;s not really designed for that either. You can do it on the same machine. I&#8217;ve done work with people that nonprofits where they can&#8217;t use American companies for security reasons, and so they can&#8217;t use CloudFlare or things like that. So you have to do a lot of the protection yourself at the machine level, but it&#8217;s not, you want those requests to be blocked. You can even overwhelm a Linux machine if you&#8217;re not careful, even with a DDoS. So that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not efficient either, right? Part of the goal of a firewall is to prevent those DDoS attacks, and you basically are not doing that with a PV based firewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/security-from-the-basics-to-enterprise-with-calvin-alkan/\">You can listen to the full episode here</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Do The Woo Community: Headless WooCommerce: Pros, Cons, and When to Use It\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5911\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/headless-woocommerce-pros-cons-and-when-to-use-it/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7873:\"<p>Headless WooCommerce is a modern approach to ecommerce websites, where the frontend (the part that users see and interact with) is separated from the backend (the part that processes data and business logic).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This separation allows developers to create custom, high-performing stores and gives them more control over the user experience. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the key to enabling communication between the frontend and backend in this headless architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In traditional WooCommerce websites, the frontend and backend are tightly coupled, limiting flexibility and potentially impacting performance. With Headless WooCommerce, developers can harness the power of decoupled architecture to create lightning-fast websites that are more adaptable to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-headless-woocommerce-works\"><strong>How Headless WooCommerce Works?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bobwp.com/defining-headless-with-woocommerce-and-wordpress/\">Headless WooCommerce</a> relies on a decoupled architecture, meaning that the frontend and backend operate independently from one another. This separation allows each layer to be developed and maintained independently, while still communicating effectively through APIs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\">REST API</a> or <a href=\"https://graphql.org\">GraphQL</a> plays a crucial role in exchanging data between the two layers, enabling them to work together seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating a custom frontend for Headless WooCommerce, developers can choose from various JavaScript frameworks such as <a href=\"https://react.dev/\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a>, or <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a>. These frameworks provide the tools needed to build interactive, high-performance user interfaces while capitalizing on WooCommerce&#8217;s robust backend infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benefits-of-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>Benefits of Headless WooCommerce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several major advantages to implementing Headless WooCommerce, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Improved performance and website speed</strong>: Separating the frontend and backend allows for optimization of each layer, leading to faster load times and an overall better user experience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More freedom for frontend developers</strong>: With a decoupled architecture, frontend developers can build custom layouts, designs, and interactivity without worrying about conflicts or limitations from the backend.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better integration capabilities</strong>: APIs make it easier to integrate other services and applications into your ecommerce platform, streamlining business processes and customer interactions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhanced security</strong>: Separating the frontend and backend can create an additional layer of security, as potential vulnerabilities in one layer might not directly impact the other.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: A headless setup supports the growth of your ecommerce business by allowing you to easily scale and adapt the frontend and backend independently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-drawbacks-of-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>Drawbacks of Headless WooCommerce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its advantages, there are potential disadvantages of opting for a Headless WooCommerce setup, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complexity in development and maintenance</strong>: Building and maintaining separate frontend and backend systems can require a higher level of technical knowledge and expertise, increasing the complexity of projects.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited access to certain plugins and tools</strong>: Some <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-plugins/\">WooCommerce plugins and tools</a> might not be compatible with a headless setup, which may affect your choice of extensions and features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost factors related to development and hosting</strong>: Customizing and hosting separate systems may increase costs compared to traditional WooCommerce implementations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Steeper learning curve</strong>: Developers might need to learn new technologies, frameworks, or architectures to effectively work with Headless WooCommerce.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Possibility of creating disjointed experiences</strong>: If the frontend and backend aren&#8217;t well-integrated, it can lead to dissonance or inconsistencies in the user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-to-use-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>When to Use Headless WooCommerce?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headless WooCommerce may not be suitable for all ecommerce stores, but it can yield significant benefits in specific situations. If your business is based on unique user experiences or needs custom interactivity that can&#8217;t be achieved with traditional themes, Headless WooCommerce could be the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses that require high scalability and flexibility are more likely to benefit from the separation of frontend and backend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, those who need to integrate their stores with external systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/erp/what-is-erp/\">ERP systems</a> or specialized CRM software, might find Headless WooCommerce more accommodating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to remember that implementing Headless WooCommerce does require more development resources and skills. Be sure you have the team and budget to handle the increased complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alternatives-to-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>Alternatives to Headless WooCommerce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all businesses are equipped or need to implement a headless approach. For those who find the concept excessive or unfit for their requirements, there are alternatives available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managed WordPress hosting solutions, for instance, provide an easier way for you to maintain your WooCommerce store. They handle technical aspects like security, backups, and updates, so you can focus on your business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, if WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t meet your needs, there are plenty of other ecommerce platforms available. Shopify, Magento, and BigCommerce each have their own distinct advantages and could be worth considering. Though they might not offer the same degree of customization and flexibility as WooCommerce, they may fit your clients needs better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\"><strong>Final Words!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headless WooCommerce presents ecommerce businesses with the chance to maximize the potential of their platforms, enabling them to create unique user experiences, optimize performance, and enhance security among others. However, the complexity of the architecture, a steeper learning curve, and potentially higher costs serve as potential challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to adopt this approach will heavily depend on your business type, resources, budget, and specific needs. Those who can meet the demands of a headless architecture can truly unlock powerful possibilities for their ecommerce store. As always, it&#8217;s vital to consider all alternatives to ensure finding the best fit for your ecommerce venture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the aim is to provide the best experience for your customers, and the choice of platform should align with this objective.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column5911_f4b5d1-72\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-5-background-color has-background has-medium-font-size\">This is a guest post from the team at <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/\">Dotstore</a></p>\n</div></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"Do The Woo Community: 10 Tips on Why You Need to Do a Marketing Post Mortem with Your Black Friday Sales\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5842\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/10-tips-on-why-you-need-to-do-a-marketing-post-mortem-with-your-black-friday-sales/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4064:\"<p>In a podcast episode on Do the Woo. hosts Adam and Emma walked listeners through the importance of doing a marketing post-mortem after your Black Friday sales. Though you may feel Black Friday is done and gone, best to revisit this to be prepared for the next time you do a huge sale on your WordPress products or services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>1. Schedule a time as soon as possible.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might be tempting to wait until the rush of orders and customer service inquiries subsides, conducting a post-mortem as soon as possible allows you to capture fresh insights while memories are still vivid. Aim for a time when things have settled but not too long after the event so that the data is still relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>2. Identify your goals and objectives.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into the numbers, clearly define your goals for Black Friday. Were you aiming to increase sales, reach a specific customer segment, or simply boost brand awareness? Having clear objectives will help you assess whether you achieved them and identify areas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>3. Gather and analyze data from various channels.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t limit your analysis to just your website traffic and sales figures. Examine data from email marketing, social media, paid advertising campaigns, and other marketing channels to get a comprehensive overview of your performance across all fronts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>4. Evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which marketing channels generated the most traffic and conversions? Which creative elements resonated best with your audience? Identify the campaigns that performed well and explore how you can replicate or enhance their strategies for future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>5. Analyze product performance.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examine which products sold well and which ones fell short of expectations. Understanding why certain items were more popular than others can inform your product development, purchasing, and pricing decisions in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>6. Identify customer behavior trends.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyze customer purchase patterns, browsing behavior, and engagement metrics to gain insights into their shopping habits and preferences. This information can guide your marketing efforts and product offerings in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>7. Gather feedback from customers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reach out to your customers via surveys, social media polls, or direct messages to gather their feedback on your Black Friday experience. Their insights can help you identify areas for improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>8. Document your findings and action plans.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a detailed report summarizing your key findings, action plans, and recommendations. Share this report with your team to ensure everyone is on the same page and can contribute to implementing the improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>9. Use the insights to inform your future marketing strategies.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t let the post-mortem be a one-time exercise.

Personally, I have read several posts and even listened to some talks. I was kind of getting the concept, but let&#8217;s just say I couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around it. (No pun intended.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/headless-woocommerce-with-jacob-arriola/\">That was until we had Jacob Arriola on the podcast.</a></strong> And it finally made sense to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Headless is More Than the Legend of Sleepy Hollow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you the way I understand it. Right? There&#8217;s a lot of different interpretations. We take WordPress and <strong>WooCommerce</strong> as an example that is a monolithic application, meaning it&#8217;s responsible for a lot of things. It&#8217;s your CMS, right? Your admins, your shop owners log in and add content, you&#8217;ve got media library, it&#8217;s got products, it&#8217;s got orders, et cetera. But it&#8217;s also responsible for serving the front end, the public facing side of your application. The product catalog page, the single product page, the cart page, <strong><a href=\"https://jacobarriola.com/post/hosted-woocommerce-checkout-headless-application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">checkout</a></strong>, so on and so forth. So it&#8217;s doing a lot of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when you talk about headless, the head really represents that view layer, that UI layer, that public facing layer. When we talk about what is headless, we kind of cut off the head or we decouple the UI, now WordPress, is no longer responsible for delivering the front end of the application. It&#8217;s only responsible for being the CMS, which it&#8217;s really, really good at, right? And then in the WooCommerce case, all the logic regarding ecommerce variations, orders, all that stuff, database facilitation, <strong><a href=\"https://jacobarriola.com/post/headless-woocommerce-stripe-checkout-graphql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payment gateways</a></strong>, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now you are now responsible for building UI in a different kind of context, whether that&#8217;s a different domain, a whole different framework, whatever the case may be, right? So we separate that out the head, the view layer, the UI, what&#8217;s publicly available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-diving-into-headless\">Diving into headless</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that clearly should give you a better idea if you had been confused before. Of course that is only the tip of the iceberg and you may want to listen to the podcast as Jacob takes even deeper into the world of headless and WoCommerce.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:15:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 23:26:18 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 23:00:32 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}', 'off');
